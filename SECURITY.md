# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The Auterity Unified AI Platform takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, vulnerability reporting process, and security considerations for the platform.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report
- **Email**: security@auterity.com
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **Process**: We'll acknowledge receipt, investigate, and keep you updated

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **npm audit**: JavaScript dependency vulnerability checking
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Code Security
- **ESLint Security Rules**: JavaScript/TypeScript security linting
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Type safety and security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Docker image scanning and hardening
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation and security groups
- **TLS/SSL**: End-to-end encryption
- **Secrets Management**: Secure credential storage

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Security Updates |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes    | Full support     |
| 0.x.x   | ❌ No     | No support       |

## 🔧 Security Considerations for Contributors

### Code Review Requirements
- All changes require security review
- Security-related changes need additional scrutiny
- Automated security checks must pass

### Secure Coding Practices
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Secure defaults for all configurations

### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security audit before major version updates
- License compatibility checking

## 🚫 Prohibited Practices

### Never Include
- API keys or access tokens
- Database credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- Internal URLs or endpoints
- Personal identifiable information (PII)

### Avoid
- Console.log statements in production
- Debug information in error messages
- Unnecessary permissions
- Overly permissive CORS policies

## 🏷️ Security Labels

We use the following labels for security-related issues:

- `🔒 security`: Security vulnerability or concern
- `🔐 enhancement`: Security improvement
- `🚨 critical`: Critical security issue requiring immediate attention
- `⚠️ moderate`: Moderate security concern
- `ℹ️ low`: Low-priority security item
