# Security Vulnerability Status

## Frontend Dependencies

### Partially Fixed Issues
- **prismjs vulnerability**: Attempted to override to >=1.30.0 but react-syntax-highlighter 15.6.6 still pulls in vulnerable refractor with prismjs 1.27.0
- **Status**: Requires major refactoring to use different syntax highlighting library or wait for refractor update
- **Risk Level**: Moderate - DOM clobbering vulnerability in syntax highlighting component
- **Workaround**: Current overrides provide partial protection

### Next Steps
- Consider replacing react-syntax-highlighter with @code-hike/lighter or similar modern alternatives
- Monitor for updates to refractor package
- Implement Content Security Policy to mitigate DOM clobbering risks

## Backend Dependencies
- **Status**: No vulnerabilities detected in core backend dependencies
- **Python packages**: Using pinned versions with security patches applied
