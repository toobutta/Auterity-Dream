# Quality Gates Documentation

## Overview

The Auterity platform implements comprehensive quality gates to ensure code quality, security, and performance across all development stages. This document explains the automated quality gates and how they work.

## Quality Gate Components

### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

Located at: `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`

#### Jobs:

1. **test** - Runs comprehensive testing across Node.js versions
   - TypeScript compilation check
   - Frontend and backend test execution
   - Linting validation
   - Build verification

2. **security-scan** - Automated security analysis
   - NPM audit for vulnerabilities
   - Bandit SAST scanning for Python code
   - Secret detection

3. **performance-test** - Performance validation
   - Frontend performance metrics
   - API response time validation
   - Bundle size monitoring

4. **code-quality** - Code coverage and quality metrics
   - Test coverage reporting
   - Codecov integration
   - Quality thresholds enforcement

5. **docker-build** - Container validation
   - Docker image building
   - Container testing
   - Multi-stage build verification

6. **integration-test** - End-to-end testing
   - Full system integration testing
   - Docker Compose orchestration
   - Service interaction validation

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks

Located at: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

#### Hooks:

- **Code formatting**: Black, Prettier, isort
- **Linting**: ESLint, Flake8, Bandit
- **Type checking**: TypeScript compilation
- **Testing**: Frontend and backend test execution
- **Security**: Secret detection, dependency scanning

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Located at: `performance.config.js`

#### Metrics Tracked:

- **Frontend Performance**:
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.8s
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
  - First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

- **API Performance**:
  - Response time < 500ms
  - Workflow execution time < 5s

- **Bundle Size**:
  - Max bundle size: 500kB
  - Max gzip size: 150kB

### 4. Security Gates

#### Tools Used:

- **NPM Audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python static application security testing
- **detect-secrets**: Secret detection and management
- **CodeQL**: Automated code security analysis

## Usage Instructions

### Running Quality Gates Locally

```bash
# Run all quality gates
npm run quality-gate

# Run individual checks
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run security-scan
npm run performance-test
```

### Pre-commit Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Manual pre-commit run
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Code Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage reports
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run performance tests
npm run performance-test

# View performance results
cat performance-results.json
```

## Quality Gate Thresholds

### Test Coverage Requirements

| Component | Minimum Coverage |
|-----------|------------------|
| Frontend  | 80%              |
| Backend   | 75%              |
| Overall   | 78%              |

### Performance Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Critical |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| FCP     | < 1.8s   | < 3.0s  |
| LCP     | < 2.5s   | < 4.0s  |
| FID     | < 100ms  | < 300ms |
| CLS     | < 0.1    | < 0.25  |

### Security Requirements

- **Zero critical vulnerabilities**
- **No high-risk security issues**
- **All secrets properly managed**
- **Dependencies up-to-date**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Pre-commit Hook Failures

```bash
# Skip hooks for urgent commits
git commit --no-verify

# Fix formatting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

#### 2. Coverage Below Threshold

```bash
# Check coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Add tests for uncovered lines
# Update coverage thresholds if justified
```

#### 3. Security Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Update dependencies
npm audit fix

# Check for available updates
npm outdated
```

#### 4. Performance Issues

```bash
# Run performance tests locally
npm run performance-test

# Check bundle analyzer
npm run build:analyze
```

### Configuration Files

- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks
- `performance.config.js` - Performance thresholds
- `codecov.yml` - Coverage configuration
- `.secrets.baseline` - Secret detection baseline

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 1. Development Branch

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push to trigger CI
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

### 2. Pull Request Process

1. **Automated Checks**: Quality gates run automatically
2. **Review Process**: Manual code review after automated checks pass
3. **Merge Protection**: Branch protection rules prevent merging with failing quality gates

### 3. Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Run production quality gates
npm run quality-gate:ci

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production
```

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Dashboard Integration

- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting
- **GitHub Checks**: CI/CD status reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
- **Security Dashboard**: Vulnerability tracking

### Alerts and Notifications

- **Email notifications** for critical failures
- **Slack integration** for team updates
- **GitHub issues** for tracking quality gate improvements

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated
- Review and update quality thresholds
- Monitor performance trends
- Address security vulnerabilities promptly

### 2. Local Development

- Run quality gates before pushing
- Use pre-commit hooks for consistency
- Test locally before CI validation
- Address issues early in development

### 3. Team Collaboration

- Document quality gate failures
- Share best practices for fixing issues
- Review quality gate configurations regularly
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
