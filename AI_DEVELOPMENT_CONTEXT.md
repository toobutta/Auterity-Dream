## üîß Development Rules for AI Tools

### Rule 1: Always Check Dependencies
Before making ANY change, verify impact on:
- Other systems in the three-system architecture
- Shared components and libraries
- Database schema and migrations
- API contracts between systems

### Rule 2: Maintain Integration Integrity
- AutoMatrix MUST route AI calls through RelayCore
- RelayCore MUST integrate with NeuroWeaver models
- All systems MUST use unified authentication
- Monitoring MUST cover all three systems

### Rule 3: Consider Enterprise Requirements
- Multi-tenant architecture
- SSO integration (SAML/OIDC)
- Audit logging and compliance
- Performance and scalability

## üö® Current Critical Issues (Context for ALL Tasks)

### 1. Test Infrastructure Crisis
- **Impact**: Blocks ALL development across ALL systems
- **Files**: 22 vitest module resolution errors
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix before any other work

### 2. TypeScript Compliance
- **Impact**: Frontend development blocked
- **Files**: 108 TypeScript errors in AutoMatrix frontend
- **Priority**: HIGH - Blocks clean development

### 3. Cross-System Integration Gaps
- **Impact**: Three systems not fully connected
- **Files**: Integration protocols incomplete
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core architecture requirement

## üìä Project Statistics (Full Scope)

### Codebase Size
- **Total Files**: 500+ files across all systems
- **Lines of Code**: ~75,000 lines
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, YAML
- **Systems**: 3 integrated platforms

### Component Breakdown
- **AutoMatrix**: 250+ files (backend + frontend)
- **RelayCore**: 100+ files (Node.js + admin UI)
- **NeuroWeaver**: 80+ files (Python + React)
- **Infrastructure**: 70+ files (Docker, Terraform, monitoring)

## üéØ Task Context Requirements

### For ANY Development Task:
1. **Read This Document First**: Understand full project scope
2. **Check Integration Impact**: How does this affect other systems?
3. **Review Related Systems**: What other components are involved?
4. **Verify Enterprise Compliance**: Does this meet enterprise requirements?
5. **Test Cross-System**: Ensure all integrations still work

### For Frontend Tasks:
- Consider AutoMatrix frontend AND RelayCore admin interface
- Ensure shared component library compatibility
- Verify cross-system authentication flows
- Check responsive design across all UIs

### For Backend Tasks:
- Consider AutoMatrix API AND NeuroWeaver API
- Ensure RelayCore integration points work
- Verify database schema compatibility
- Check monitoring and logging integration

### For Infrastructure Tasks:
- Consider ALL three systems in deployment
- Ensure monitoring covers all components
- Verify security across entire platform
- Check scalability for all services

## üîÑ Integration Flow (MUST Understand)

```
User Request ‚Üí AutoMatrix Frontend ‚Üí AutoMatrix Backend ‚Üí RelayCore ‚Üí AI Provider/NeuroWeaver ‚Üí Response Chain
```

### Critical Integration Points:
1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens shared across all systems
2. **AI Routing**: All AI calls go through RelayCore
3. **Model Access**: RelayCore routes to NeuroWeaver when appropriate
4. **Monitoring**: Unified metrics collection across all systems
5. **Error Handling**: Cross-system error correlation

## üìö Required Reading for ALL Tasks

### Architecture Documents:
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
- `/.kiro/specs/three-system-ai-platform/design.md`
- `/PROJECT_STRUCTURE_COMPREHENSIVE.md`

### Integration Specifications:
- `/.kiro/specs/three-system-ai-platform/requirements.md`
- `/PRD/RelayCore/integration_architecture.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Scope Blindness Prevention

### Common AI Tool Mistakes:
1. **Tunnel Vision**: Only looking at immediate files
2. **Integration Ignorance**: Not considering cross-system impact
3. **Architecture Amnesia**: Forgetting the three-system design
4. **Enterprise Oversight**: Missing enterprise requirements

### Prevention Protocol:
1. **Always start with this document**
2. **Review integration points before coding**
3. **Check all three systems for impact**
4. **Verify enterprise compliance**
5. **Test cross-system functionality**

## üéØ Success Criteria for ALL Tasks

### Technical Success:
- All three systems continue to work together
- Integration points remain functional
- Enterprise requirements are met
- Performance standards maintained

### Quality Success:
- Code quality standards across all systems
- Security requirements for entire platform
- Documentation updated for all affected systems
- Tests cover cross-system functionality
