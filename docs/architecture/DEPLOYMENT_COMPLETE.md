##

 3. Setup Local Monitoring (5 minute

s

)

```

bash

# Make scripts executable and setup monitoring

chmod +x scripts/*.sh

./scripts/setup-monitoring.s

h

# Start monitoring stack

docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -

d

```

#

##

 4. Validate Current Deployment (2 minute

s

)

```

bash

# Run validation on current deployment

./scripts/validate-deployment.sh productio

n

# Check health of all services

./scripts/health-check.s

h

```

## Common Issues and Solution

s

#

###

 1. Workflow Permission Erro

r

s

```

bash

# Check repository settings > Actions > Genera

l

# Ensure "Read and write permissions" is enabled

```

#

###

 2. Docker Build Failur

e

s

```

bash

# Verify Dockerfile exists in frontend/backend directorie

s

# Check Docker buildx configuration

```

#

###

 3. Deployment Validation Failur

e

s

```

bash

# Run health check to identify issues

./scripts/health-check.s

h

# Check service logs

docker-compose logs backend fronten

d

```

#

###

 4. Monitoring Stack Issu

e

s

```

bash

# Restart monitoring services

docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml restar

t

# Check Prometheus targets

curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets

```
