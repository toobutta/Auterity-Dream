# ðŸªª Process Mining Documentation

## Overview

Documentation for the Process Mining dashboard and services: extracting, transforming, and analyzing event logs to derive process models, KPIs, and optimization insights.

## Components

- Frontend: `frontend/src/components/process-mining/ProcessMiningDashboard.tsx`
- Frontend services: `frontend/src/services/processMiningService.ts`
- Backend services: process mining engine (API: `/api/v1/process-mining/*`)

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as Dashboard
  participant API as Process Mining API
  participant ENG as Mining Engine
  participant DB as Event Store

  UI->>API: POST /analyze (parameters)
  API->>ENG: Start job
  ENG->>DB: Read event logs
  ENG-->>API: Results (model, KPIs, variants)
  API-->>UI: Renderable payload
```

## Features

- Event log ingestion and schema mapping
- Model discovery (e.g., variants, bottlenecks, throughput)
- Conformance checking
- What-if analysis and recommendations

## Payloads (Conceptual)

```json
{
  "model": { "nodes": [], "edges": [] },
  "kpis": { "cycle_time_avg": 1234, "throughput": 56 },
  "variants": [ {"path": ["A","B","C"], "count": 120} ],
  "bottlenecks": [ {"node": "B", "wait_ms": 45000} ]
}
```

## UI Considerations

- Graph visualization (zoom/pan), node/edge insights
- Variant table with filters and search
- KPI cards and trend charts
