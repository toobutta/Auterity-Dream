w

This document outlines the pipeline optimization changes implemented to improve build times, reduce resource usage, and enhance reliability across all CI/CD pipelines in the Auterity Unified project.

#

# Optimization Strategie

s

#

##

 1. Streamlined Build Process

e

s

#

### Path Filterin

g

- Added `paths-ignore` to skip CI runs for documentation change

s

- This prevents unnecessary builds when only documentation files are modifie

d

- Example:



```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main, develop]
      paths-ignore

:

        - "**/*.md

"

        - "docs/**

"

        - ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**"



```

#

### Concurrency Contro

l

- Added `concurrency` groups to prevent redundant workflow run

s

- Configured `cancel-in-progress: true` to automatically cancel outdated run

s

- This ensures resources aren't wasted on obsolete build

s

- Example:



```

yaml
  concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

    cancel-in-progress: true



```

#

### Smart Matrix Builds (NeuroWeaver

)

- Implemented dynamic component matrix based on changed file

s

- Only builds components that have been modified in PR

s

- Builds all components for direct pushes to main branche

s

- This significantly reduces build time for PRs with limited scop

e

- Example

:



```

yaml

  - name: Determine components to build

    id: set-matrix

    run: |
      if [[ "${{ github.event_name }}" == "pull_request" ]]; then


# For PRs, only build components with changes

        CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/${{ github.base_ref }}...HEAD)

        COMPONENTS=()

        for COMPONENT in template-system auto-specializer inference-weaver dataset-refinement costguard-dashboard workflow-ui; do

          if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -q "src/$COMPONENT/"; then

            COMPONENTS+=("$COMPONENT")

          fi
        done



# If no components have changes, build all

        if [ ${

#COMPONENTS[@]} -eq 0 ]; the

n

          COMPONENTS=(template-system auto-specializer inference-weaver dataset-refinement costguard-dashboard workflow-ui)

        fi
      else


# For direct pushes, build all components

        COMPONENTS=(template-system auto-specializer inference-weaver dataset-refinement costguard-dashboard workflow-ui)

      fi

      echo "matrix={\"component\":[\"$(IFS=\\\",\\\"; echo "${COMPONENTS[*]}")\"]}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT



```

 2. Parallelized Tas

k

s

#

### Parallel Job Executio

n

- Restructured workflows to run independent jobs in paralle

l

- Separated setup, build, test, and deployment phase

s

- Used job dependencies (`needs:`) to create efficient pipeline

s

- Example

:



```

yaml
  jobs:
    setup:


# Setup job runs firs

t

    backend-test:

      needs: setup


# Runs after setu

p

    frontend-test:

      needs: setup


# Runs in parallel with backend-tes

t



```

#

### Parallel Command Executio

n

- Implemented parallel execution of lint and test command

s

- Used background processes with `&` and `wait` to run tasks concurrentl

y

- Example:



```

yaml

  - name: Lint and Test

    run: |
      npm run lint &
      npm test &
      wait


```

#

### Multi-Platform Buil

d

s

- Added multi-platform Docker builds (amd64/arm64) for RelayCor

e

- Used Docker BuildX for efficient cross-platform build

s

- Example:



```

yaml

  - name: Build and push Docker image

    uses: docker/build-push-action@v4

    with:
      context: .
      push: true
      tags: relaycore/relaycore:latest,relaycore/relaycore:${{ github.sha }}
      cache-from: type=registry,ref=relaycore/relaycore:latest

      cache-to: type=inline

      platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
      build-args: |

        BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1


```

      path: node_modules
      key: ${{ needs.setup.outputs.cache-key }}

      restore-keys: |

        relaycore-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

        relaycore

      path: /tmp/docker-images/${{ matrix.component }}.tar

      key: docker-${{ matrix.component }}-${{ github.sha }

}

  - name: Save Docker image

    run: |
      mkdir -p /tmp/docker-images

      docker save neuroweaver/${{ matrix.component }}:${{ github.sha }} > /tmp/docker-images/${{ matrix.component }}.tar



```

#

### Infrastructure Cachin

g

      path: |
        terraform/${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'development' }}/.terraform
        terraform/${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'development' }}/.terraform.lock.hcl
      key: terraform-${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'development' }}-${{ hashFiles('terraform/${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'development' }}/*.tf') }}
