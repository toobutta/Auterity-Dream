## Key Concepts

### Workflows
A workflow is a series of connected steps that process data automatically. Each workflow has:
- **Input** - Data that starts the workflow
- **Processing Steps** - AI-powered or rule-based processing
- **Output** - Final result of the workflow

### Templates
Pre-built workflows for common dealership scenarios:
- **Customer Inquiry Processing** - Analyze and respond to customer questions
- **Service Appointment Scheduling** - Process service requests
- **Parts Inquiry** - Handle parts availability requests
- **Lead Qualification** - Score and route sales leads

### AI Processing
Auterity uses advanced AI to:
- Understand customer intent
- Generate personalized responses
- Extract information from text
- Make intelligent recommendations

## Common Use Cases
