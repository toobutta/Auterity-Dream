# 🏗️ Domain-Specific Extensions (Future Development)

## Overview

This document outlines the planned domain-specific extensions for Auterity's core platform. These extensions will be developed as separate modules to maintain a clean separation between core platform functionality and domain-specific implementations.

## Planned Extensions

### Healthcare Extension
- Patient flow optimization
- Clinical decision support
- Compliance automation (HIPAA)
- Medical data integration

### Financial Services Extension
- Risk assessment models
- Fraud detection
- Regulatory compliance
- Transaction monitoring

### Manufacturing Extension
- Equipment monitoring
- Quality control
- Supply chain optimization
- Predictive maintenance

### Automotive Extension
- Lead management
- Service optimization
- Inventory forecasting
- Customer lifecycle
