# Refactoring Report: AIService to LiteLLMService Integration

## Task Summary

**Task ID**: RF-2023-11-15
**Date**: November 15, 2023
**Developer**: Zencoder AI
**Status**: Completed

## Overview

Refactored the `AIService` class to use the new `LiteLLMService` for multi-provider model support, enabling the application to use AI models from different providers through a unified interface.

## Objectives

- Implement a flexible multi-provider AI model integration
- Add support for model fallbacks and resilience
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Externalize model configuration for easier management
- Add capability-based model selection

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- `/backend/app/services/ai_service.py` - Updated to use LiteLLMService
- `/backend/app/services/litellm_service.py` - Implemented new service
- `/backend/requirements.txt` - Added new dependencies
- `/backend/config/models.yaml` - Added model configuration file

### New Dependencies

- litellm==1.10.1
- pyyaml==6.0.1

### Tests Added

- `/backend/app/tests/services/test_ai_service.py`
- `/backend/app/tests/services/test_litellm_service.py`

## Technical Details

### LiteLLMService Features

- **Model Configuration**: Loads model configurations from YAML file
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and other providers
- **Fallback Logic**: Automatically tries alternative models when primary models fail
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements exponential backoff for transient errors
- **Capability-Based Selection**: Allows selecting models by capability (e.g., reasoning, function calling)

### AIService Changes

- Delegated API calls to LiteLLMService
- Maintained same interface for prompt templating and response validation
- Added method to get available models
- Preserved backward compatibility

### Model Configuration

The new YAML configuration allows for:

- Defining models from different providers
- Specifying model capabilities, costs, and token limits
- Easy addition of new models without code changes

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully, verifying:

- Correct integration between AIService and LiteLLMService
- Proper handling of model fallbacks
- Accurate capability-based model selection
- Backward compatibility with existing code

## Benefits

1. **Multi-provider support**: Use models from different providers through a unified interface
2. **Improved resilience**: Automatic fallbacks when primary models fail
3. **Better configuration management**: Externalized model configurations
4. **Capability-based model selection**: Select models based on capabilities
5. **Cost optimization**: Configuration includes cost information for optimization
6. **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without modifications

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining TODOs in LiteLLMService
2. Add more providers to model configurations
3. Implement cost tracking and optimization
4. Add JSON schema validation for responses
5. Update API documentation to reflect new capabilities

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully integrates LiteLLMService with AIService, providing a more flexible, resilient, and maintainable solution for AI model interactions. The changes maintain backward compatibility while adding significant new capabilities.
