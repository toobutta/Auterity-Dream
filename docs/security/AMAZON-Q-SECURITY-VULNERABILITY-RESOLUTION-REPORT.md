## Security Best Practice

s

1. **Dependency Overrides**: Effective for forcing secure versions across dependency chai

n

s

2. **Regular Auditing**: npm audit should be part of regular development workfl

o

w

3. **Security-First Approach**: Security fixes should be prioritized over feature developme

n

#

## Technical Insight

s

1. **Import Path Management**: Shared component paths need careful management in monorepo structu

r

e

2. **Build System Resilience**: Proper error handling prevents cascading build failur

e

s

3. **Component Isolation**: Well-designed components can handle dependency updates graceful
