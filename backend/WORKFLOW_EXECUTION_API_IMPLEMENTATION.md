# Workflow Execution API Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 7: "Create workflow execution API endpoints" from the workflow engine MVP specification. The implementation provides comprehensive API endpoints for executing workflows, monitoring their progress, and managing execution lifecycle.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. Workflow Execution Trigger
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute`
- **Purpose**: Execute a workflow with provided input data
- **Features**:
  - Input validation using Pydantic schemas
  - User access control (users can only execute their own workflows)
  - Async execution using WorkflowEngine
  - Proper error handling and status codes
- **Response**: Returns execution ID and initial status (202 Accepted)

### 2. Execution Status Monitoring
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/workflows/executions/{execution_id}`
- **Purpose**: Get current status and details of a workflow execution
- **Features**:
  - Real-time status information
  - Input/output data access
  - Error message reporting
  - User isolation (users can only access their own executions)

### 3. Execution Log Retrieval
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/workflows/executions/{execution_id}/logs`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve detailed step-by-step execution logs
- **Features**:
  - Filtering by step type, step name, and error status
  - Configurable result limits (1-1000 logs)
  - Chronological ordering
  - Performance metrics (duration per step)

### 4. Execution Cancellation
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/workflows/executions/{execution_id}/cancel`
- **Purpose**: Cancel a running workflow execution
- **Features**:
  - Only allows cancellation of pending/running executions
  - Updates execution status to cancelled
  - Proper error handling for invalid states

### 5. Execution Listing
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/workflows/executions`
- **Purpose**: List workflow executions with filtering and pagination
- **Features**:
  - Filter by workflow ID and execution status
  - Pagination with configurable limits and offsets
  - Ordered by execution start time (most recent first)
  - User isolation

## Request/Response Schemas

### WorkflowExecuteRequest
```python
class WorkflowExecuteRequest(BaseModel):
    input_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

### ExecutionResultResponse
```python
class ExecutionResultResponse(BaseModel):
    execution_id: uuid.UUID
    status: str
    output_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    error_message: Optional[str]
```

### ExecutionStatusResponse
```python
class ExecutionStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    id: uuid.UUID
    workflow_id: uuid.UUID
    status: str
    input_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    output_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    error_message: Optional[str]
    started_at: datetime
    completed_at: Optional[datetime]
```

### ExecutionLogResponse
```python
class ExecutionLogResponse(BaseModel):
    id: uuid.UUID
    step_name: str
    step_type: str
    input_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    output_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    duration_ms: Optional[int]
    error_message: Optional[str]
    timestamp: datetime
```

## Security Features

### User Access Control
- All endpoints verify that the user can only access their own workflows and executions
- JWT token authentication required for all endpoints
- Database queries include user ID filtering to prevent data leakage

### Input Validation
- Pydantic schemas validate all request data
- UUID validation for workflow and execution IDs
- Query parameter validation with appropriate limits

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Graceful handling of workflow engine exceptions

## Integration with Workflow Engine

The API endpoints integrate seamlessly with the existing WorkflowEngine service:

- **execute_workflow()**: Triggers async workflow execution
- **get_execution_status()**: Retrieves execution state from database
- **cancel_execution()**: Updates execution status via engine
- **get_execution_logs()**: Queries execution logs with filtering

## Testing Implementation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
The implementation includes a complete test suite (`test_workflow_execution_api.py`) covering:

#### Success Scenarios
- Successful workflow execution
- Status retrieval for completed executions
- Log retrieval with various filters
- Successful execution cancellation
- Execution listing with pagination

#### Error Scenarios
- Non-existent workflow/execution access
- Invalid input validation
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Cancellation of non-cancellable executions
- Invalid filter parameters

#### Security Testing
- User isolation verification
- Cross-user access prevention
- Authentication requirement validation

#### Edge Cases
- Empty input data handling
- Large result set pagination
- Multiple filter combinations
- Concurrent execution scenarios

## API Usage Examples

### Execute a Workflow
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input_data": {"message": "Hello World"}}'
```

### Get Execution Status
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/executions/{execution_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Get Execution Logs with Filtering
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/executions/{execution_id}/logs?step_type=ai&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Cancel Execution
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/executions/{execution_id}/cancel" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### List Executions
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/executions?status_filter=running&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

## Requirements Mapping

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- **Requirement 2.1**: Workflow execution with sequential step processing
- **Requirement 2.3**: Execution logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Requirement 3.2**: Real-time execution status monitoring
- **Requirement 3.3**: Execution history and analytics access
- **Requirement 6.2**: API-based workflow execution triggering
- **Requirement 6.3**: Execution status API endpoints
- **Requirement 6.4**: Error handling and status reporting

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries on execution_id and workflow_id
- Efficient filtering using database-level WHERE clauses
- Pagination to prevent large result sets

### Async Processing
- Non-blocking workflow execution
- Async database operations
- Proper resource cleanup

### Caching Opportunities
- Execution status caching for frequently accessed executions
- Log result caching for static completed executions

## Future Enhancements

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket support for live execution monitoring
- Server-sent events for status updates

### Advanced Filtering
- Date range filtering for executions
- Full-text search in execution logs
- Performance metrics aggregation

### Batch Operations
- Bulk execution cancellation
- Batch status retrieval
- Execution comparison tools

## Conclusion

The workflow execution API implementation provides a robust, secure, and comprehensive interface for managing workflow executions. It includes proper error handling, user isolation, comprehensive testing, and integrates seamlessly with the existing workflow engine architecture.

The implementation is ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for building the frontend execution monitoring interface.
