## 1. Dependency Analysis

### Frontend Dependencies (package.json)

#### Security Vulnerabilities - CRITICAL 🔴
```
7 moderate severity vulnerabilities detected:

1. esbuild ≤0.24.2 - Development server vulnerability
   - Impact: Allows websites to send requests to dev server
   - Fix: Update to vite@7.0.6 (breaking change)

2. prismjs <1.30.0 - DOM Clobbering vulnerability  
   - Impact: Security vulnerability in syntax highlighting
   - Fix: Update react-syntax-highlighter (breaking change)
```

#### Missing Dependencies - MEDIUM 🟡
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` - Required for test coverage but causes version conflicts
- Coverage tooling incompatible with current vitest version (0.34.6)

#### Outdated Dependencies - LOW 🟢
- Most dependencies are reasonably current
- TypeScript version (5.8.3) newer than officially supported by ESLint plugin

#### Bundle Size Analysis
```
Total bundle size: 1.5MB
Largest chunks:
- syntax-highlighter: 631.26 kB (229.87 kB gzipped) ⚠️
- charts library: 323.54 kB (94.64 kB gzipped)
- react-vendor: 162.58 kB (53.04 kB gzipped)
- workflow-viz: 151.01 kB (49.24 kB gzipped)
```

### Backend Dependencies (requirements.txt)

#### Security Status - GOOD ✅
- No immediate security vulnerabilities detected
- Dependencies are reasonably current
- Production dependencies properly separated

#### Potential Issues
- Missing development dependencies for linting/formatting in requirements.txt
- No explicit version pinning for some transitive dependencies

---

## 2. TypeScript Compliance Analysis

### Frontend TypeScript Issues - HIGH PRIORITY 🔴

#### Linting Errors: 19 total
```
Critical Issues:
- 16 instances of explicit 'any' type usage
- 1 unused variable ('workflowsApi')
- 2 additional type safety violations

Files with highest violation count:
1. WorkflowErrorDisplay.test.tsx - 7 'any' violations
2. WorkflowExecutionInterface.test.tsx - 5 'any' violations  
3. WorkflowExecutionResults.test.tsx - 4 'any' violations
4. retryUtils.ts - 1 'any' violation
```

#### TypeScript Version Compatibility
- Using TypeScript 5.8.3 (newer than ESLint plugin supports)
- Recommended: Downgrade to TypeScript 5.3.x for full compatibility

#### Type Definition Completeness - GOOD ✅
- Comprehensive type definitions in `/types` directory
- Proper API response types in `workflows.d.ts`
- Good interface consistency across components

## 3. Test Coverage Analysis

### Frontend Test Results - NEEDS ATTENTION 🟡

#### Test Statistics
```
Total Tests: 250
Passed: 206 (82.4%)
Failed: 35 (14.0%)
Errors: 1 memory error
```

#### Critical Test Failures
1. **Memory Issues**: JS heap out of memory during test execution
2. **Mock Configuration**: Missing mock exports causing test failures
3. **API Integration**: Inconsistent mock setup across test files
4. **Component Integration**: Some integration tests failing due to mock mismatches

#### Test Coverage Issues
- Cannot generate coverage report due to dependency conflicts
- Vitest coverage plugin incompatible with current version
- Estimated coverage: ~75-80% based on test file analysis

### Backend Test Status - NOT ASSESSED
- Backend tests not executed due to Python environment issues
- Extensive test files present indicating good test coverage intention

---

## 4. Code Quality Assessment

### Frontend Code Quality - MIXED 🟡

#### Strengths
- Consistent component structure and patterns
- Good use of TypeScript interfaces
- Proper error handling patterns
- Accessibility considerations in components

#### Issues
- Excessive use of `any` types in test files
- Some components could benefit from better memoization
- Bundle size optimization opportunities

### Backend Code Quality - POOR 🔴

#### Linting Issues: 500+ violations
```
Major Categories:
- Import organization: 50+ violations (E402 - imports not at top)
- Unused imports: 100+ violations (F401)
- Whitespace issues: 200+ violations (W293, W291)
- Line length: 50+ violations (E501 - >88 characters)
- Bare except clauses: Multiple violations (E722)
```

#### Critical Issues
- Inconsistent import organization
- Many unused imports indicating dead code
- Formatting inconsistencies throughout codebase
- Some undefined name references (F821)

## 5. Performance Analysis

### Frontend Performance

#### Bundle Optimization Opportunities
1. **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for large components
2. **Syntax Highlighter**: Consider lighter alternative or lazy loading
3. **Chart Library**: Evaluate if full Recharts library is needed
4. **Tree Shaking**: Improve to reduce unused code

#### Runtime Performance
- React components generally well-structured
- Some opportunities for memoization in complex components
- Good use of lazy loading patterns

### Backend Performance
