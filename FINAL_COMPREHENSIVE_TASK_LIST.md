**Amazon Q Domain** (40 hours/week):
- Test infrastructure debugging and repair
- RelayCore backend (routing engine, steering rules)
- NeuroWeaver backend (training pipeline, model registry)
- MCP architecture implementation
- Multi-model AI infrastructure
- Enterprise security and monitoring

**Cursor IDE Domain** (40 hours/week):
- TypeScript compliance cleanup
- RelayCore admin interface (dashboard, analytics)
- NeuroWeaver frontend (model management, training UI)
- GenAI AgentOS integration (visual agent creation)
- Advanced workflow builder enhancement
- Integration hub and analytics platform

**Kiro Orchestration** (20 hours/week):
- Three-system integration architecture
- MCP orchestration platform design
- Quality gate automation framework
- Strategic coordination and oversight
- Documentation and developer experience
```

### **Quality Gate Automation**
```markdown
**After each task completion**:
1. 🔒 Automated security scan (blocks if vulnerabilities)
2. ⚡ Performance regression test (blocks if >5% degradation)
3. 🔗 Integration compatibility check (blocks if contracts broken)
4. 📊 Code quality validation (blocks if standards not met)

**Success**: Automatic merge and next task activation
**Failure**: Immediate feedback and autonomous remediation
```

### **Risk Mitigation**
```markdown
**High-Risk Tasks**: Test infrastructure repair, TypeScript compliance
**Mitigation**: Parallel execution with fallback plans
**Dependencies**: Clear task sequencing with minimal blocking
**Quality Assurance**: Automated gates prevent regression
**Rollback Plans**: Git branches enable easy recovery
```
