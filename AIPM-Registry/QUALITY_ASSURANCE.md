:

- ≥ 95% of records have non-empty: `Path`, `Record_Type`, `Resource_Name`, `Source_Links`, `Maintainer`, `Version`

.

- ≥ 90% of functions have `Arguments_Schema` (or explicit N/

A

 + reason)

.

- ≥ 85% of models have `Pricing_In/Out`, `Context_Window`, `Modalities`, `Tool_Use/JSON_Mode`

.

- For each top category, at least 1 record exists for every sub-category in the coverage map above

.

- Zero duplicate `Path

 + `Resource_Name

`

 + `Version` combos (dedupe key)
