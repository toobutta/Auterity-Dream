# GitHub Environment Setup Checklist

## Required Repository Settings

### 1. Repository Secrets
Navigate to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**

#### Required Secrets:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - ‚úÖ Automatically provided by GitHub
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username (optional)
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password (optional)

#### Optional Secrets (for enhanced functionality):
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For Slack notifications
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - For Discord notifications
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` - For Microsoft Teams notifications
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_KEY` - SSH key for production deployment

### 2. Environment Configuration
Navigate to **Settings > Environments**

#### Create Production Environment:
1. Click "New environment"
2. Name: `production`
3. Configure protection rules:
   - ‚úÖ Required reviewers (recommended: 1-2 reviewers)
   - ‚úÖ Wait timer: 0 minutes (or as needed)
   - ‚úÖ Deployment branches: Selected branches only
   - Add branch: `main`

### 3. Branch Protection Rules
Navigate to **Settings > Branches**

#### Protect Main Branch:
1. Click "Add rule"
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB

### 4. Actions Permissions
Navigate to **Settings > Actions > General**

#### Configure Permissions:
- ‚úÖ Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- ‚úÖ Allow actions created by GitHub
- ‚úÖ Allow actions by Marketplace verified creators

#### Workflow Permissions:
- ‚úÖ Read and write permissions
- ‚úÖ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Workflow Triggers
```bash
# Create a test tag to verify release workflow
git tag -a v0.0.1-test -m "Test release workflow"
git push origin v0.0.1-test

# Check Actions tab for workflow execution
```

### 2. Monitor Workflow Execution
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Verify workflows are running successfully
3. Check for any permission or configuration errors

### 3. Validate Docker Registry Access
1. Verify Docker images are being pushed to GitHub Container Registry
2. Check **Packages** tab in your repository
3. Ensure images are tagged correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Permission Denied Errors
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has correct permissions
- Check repository settings for Actions permissions

#### 2. Docker Build Failures
- Ensure Dockerfile exists in frontend/backend directories
- Verify Docker buildx is properly configured

#### 3. Environment Protection Rules
- Check if production environment requires manual approval
- Verify branch protection rules are not blocking deployment

#### 4. Artifact Upload Issues
- Ensure artifact paths are correct
- Check artifact retention policies

## Next Steps After Setup

1. **Test the Complete Pipeline**:
   - Create a feature branch
   - Make a small change
   - Create pull request
   - Merge to main
   - Create release tag

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check workflow execution times
   - Verify caching is working effectively
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **Configure Notifications**:
   - Set up Slack/Discord webhooks
   - Configure email notifications
   - Test notification delivery

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Update deployment scripts in release.yml
   - Configure production environment variables
   - Test deployment process
