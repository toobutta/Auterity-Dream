# Auterity Agent Framework Integration

This document outlines the comprehensive integration of LangChain, Haystack, and LlamaIndex into the Auterity Unified AI Platform, providing enterprise-grade agent orchestration, RAG capabilities, and compliance management.

## Architecture Overview

The Auterity Agent Framework consists of four core components:

1. **Agent Orchestrator** - Multi-agent coordination using LangChain
2. **RAG Engine** - Document retrieval and Q&A using Haystack & LlamaIndex  
3. **Compliance Layer** - Enterprise compliance and audit trails
4. **Security Manager** - Authentication, encryption, and threat detection

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Orchestrator (`app/services/agents/orchestrator.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages the lifecycle and coordination of AI agents across AutoMatrix, RelayCore, and NeuroWeaver systems.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-agent registration and management
- Sequential, parallel, and hierarchical coordination strategies
- Memory management and conversation state
- Compliance-aware execution with audit trails
- Custom callback handlers for monitoring

**Coordination Strategies**:
- **Sequential**: Agents execute one after another, passing results forward
- **Parallel**: Agents execute simultaneously for independent tasks
- **Hierarchical**: Manager agents delegate tasks to worker agents

### 2. RAG Engine (`app/services/agents/rag_engine.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides enterprise-grade retrieval-augmented generation capabilities for knowledge management and intelligent information retrieval.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-modal document processing (text, PDFs, structured data)
- Domain-specific knowledge bases (automotive, healthcare, finance)
- Real-time index updates and synchronization
- Compliance-aware retrieval with tenant isolation
- Integration with both Haystack and LlamaIndex

**Supported Operations**:
- Document indexing with preprocessing
- Semantic search and retrieval
- Question-answering with confidence scores
- Document updates and re-indexing

### 3. Compliance Layer (`app/services/agents/compliance_layer.py`)

**Purpose**: Ensures all agent operations comply with enterprise and regulatory requirements.

**Compliance Levels**:
- **BASIC**: Standard audit logging and access controls
- **GDPR**: EU privacy regulation compliance with anonymization
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection requirements
- **SOX**: Financial compliance with segregation of duties
- **AUTOMOTIVE**: Industry-specific automotive regulations
- **FINANCE**: Financial services compliance requirements

**Key Features**:
- Data classification (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted, PII, PHI)
- Access control validation based on user permissions
- Audit trail generation with unique tracking IDs
- Data anonymization for privacy compliance
- Compliance reporting and violation tracking

### 4. Security Manager (`app/services/agents/security_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides enterprise-grade security for all agent operations.

**Security Features**:
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- AES encryption for sensitive data protection
- Threat detection using pattern matching
- Rate limiting and IP blocking
- Security event logging and monitoring

**Threat Detection**:
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention
- Command injection protection
- Path traversal attack prevention

## API Endpoints

The agent framework exposes RESTful APIs through `/api/agents/`:

### Agent Management
- `POST /api/agents/register` - Register new agents
- `GET /api/agents/status` - Get agent system status

### Workflow Execution
- `POST /api/agents/execute` - Execute workflows with agent coordination

### RAG Operations
- `POST /api/agents/rag/query` - Query knowledge base
- `POST /api/agents/rag/index` - Index new documents

### Compliance & Security
- `POST /api/agents/compliance/validate` - Validate operations for compliance
- `GET /api/agents/health` - Health check endpoint

## Frontend Integration

The Agent Dashboard (`frontend/src/components/agents/AgentDashboard.tsx`) provides a comprehensive interface for:

### Overview Tab
- Real-time metrics for active agents, executions, security status
- Recent activity feed with status indicators
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

### Agents Tab
- Agent registration interface
- Live agent status monitoring
- Agent type and capability management

### Workflows Tab
- Workflow execution interface with JSON input
- Coordination strategy selection (sequential/parallel/hierarchical)
- Execution history with detailed results

### RAG Tab
- Natural language query interface
- Domain-specific search capabilities
- Document relevance scoring and source attribution
