# Secret Rotation Lambda Functio

n

This directory contains the Lambda function code for rotating secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

#

# Implementatio

n

The actual implementation would need to be packaged as a ZIP file for deployment:

```bash

# Install dependencies

npm init -y

npm install aws-sd

k

# Create ZIP file

zip -r rotate-secrets.zip index.js node_module

s

```

#

# Customizatio

n

The rotation logic should be customized based on the type of secrets being rotated:

1. **API Keys**: For third-party API keys, you may need to call their API to generate new ke

y

s

2. **Database Credentials**: For database credentials, you'll need to connect to the database and update user passwor

d

s

3. **JWT Secrets**: For JWT signing keys, you may need to generate new cryptographic ke

y

s

# Testin

g

Before deploying to production, test the rotation function thoroughly:

```

bash
aws secretsmanager test-rotate-secret

\
    --secret-id your-secret-id

\
    --client-request-token test-toke

n

```

#

# Security Consideration

s

- The Lambda function should have minimal permissions (principle of least privilege

)

- Ensure error handling doesn't expose sensitive informatio

n

- Consider implementing additional logging and monitoring for rotation event
