# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture feature enables Auterity to become a multi-agent orchestration platform that can coordinate between different AI tools, models, and services through standardized protocols. This feature transforms Auterity from a single-workflow automation tool into a comprehensive agent orchestration hub that can manage complex multi-agent workflows, enable seamless tool-to-tool communication, and provide a unified interface for managing diverse AI capabilities.

The MCP architecture will integrate with the existing workflow engine while adding support for agent-to-agent communication, context sharing, and protocol-based tool coordination. This enables advanced use cases like multi-step reasoning workflows, collaborative AI problem-solving, and sophisticated automation that requires coordination between specialized AI agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to create multi-agent workflows that can coordinate between different AI tools and models, so that I can build sophisticated automation that leverages the strengths of different AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide agent node types for different protocols (MCP, GenAI, A2A, OpenAI)
2. WHEN a user connects agent nodes THEN the system SHALL validate protocol compatibility and connection requirements
3. WHEN a user configures an agent node THEN the system SHALL provide protocol-specific configuration options and validation
4. WHEN a workflow contains multiple agent types THEN the system SHALL enable context passing and data transformation between agents
5. IF an agent protocol requires authentication THEN the system SHALL provide secure credential management for that protocol

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage and monitor multi-agent communications and protocol connections, so that I can ensure reliable operation and troubleshoot issues in complex agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL log all inter-agent messages with timestamps and context
2. WHEN a protocol connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested remediation
3. WHEN monitoring agent workflows THEN the system SHALL display real-time status of all agent connections and communications
4. WHEN an agent becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect the failure and trigger appropriate recovery procedures
5. IF multiple agents are processing simultaneously THEN the system SHALL provide a unified dashboard showing all agent activities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate external AI tools and services through standardized protocols, so that I can extend Auterity's capabilities without custom development for each integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering a new MCP server THEN the system SHALL automatically discover available tools and capabilities
2. WHEN an MCP server provides tools THEN the system SHALL make those tools available as workflow nodes
3. WHEN configuring protocol connections THEN the system SHALL provide auto-completion and validation for protocol-specific parameters
4. WHEN a protocol specification changes THEN the system SHALL detect the change and update available capabilities
5. IF a protocol requires specific authentication THEN the system SHALL provide secure storage and management of credentials

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow executor, I want agent workflows to maintain context and state across multi-step processes, so that complex reasoning and problem-solving workflows can operate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent workflow executes THEN the system SHALL maintain shared context accessible to all participating agents
2. WHEN context is updated by one agent THEN the system SHALL make the updated context available to subsequent agents in the workflow
3. WHEN a workflow spans multiple execution sessions THEN the system SHALL persist and restore agent context appropriately
4. WHEN agents need to share large data objects THEN the system SHALL provide efficient context storage and retrieval mechanisms
5. IF context becomes corrupted or inconsistent THEN the system SHALL detect the issue and provide recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to use pre-configured agent workflows for common business processes, so that I can leverage multi-agent capabilities without technical configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing workflow templates THEN the system SHALL provide multi-agent templates for common business scenarios
2. WHEN instantiating a multi-agent template THEN the system SHALL automatically configure all required agent connections and protocols
3. WHEN using a template THEN the system SHALL provide guided configuration for business-specific parameters
4. WHEN a template requires external services THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for service setup and authentication
5. IF a template dependency is unavailable THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative configurations or fallback options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to control and audit all agent communications and external connections, so that I can maintain security compliance and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate externally THEN the system SHALL enforce security policies and access controls
2. WHEN external protocols are used THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all data exchanges
3. WHEN storing agent credentials THEN the system SHALL use encrypted storage with appropriate access controls
4. WHEN auditing agent activities THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logs of all communications and data access
5. IF suspicious agent behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and optionally quarantine the agent

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to monitor and optimize multi-agent workflow performance, so that I can ensure efficient resource utilization and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multi-agent workflows execute THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics for each agent and communication channel
2. WHEN analyzing workflow performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed timing and resource usage statistics
3. WHEN bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL identify the source and suggest optimization strategies
4. WHEN agents are idle or overloaded THEN the system SHALL provide load balancing and resource allocation recommendations
5. IF performance degrades over time THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an integration specialist, I want to configure and test protocol connections before deploying them in production workflows, so that I can ensure reliability and proper functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a new protocol connection THEN the system SHALL provide a test interface to validate connectivity
2. WHEN testing protocol functionality THEN the system SHALL provide sample requests and expected responses
3. WHEN validating agent configurations THEN the system SHALL check all required parameters and dependencies
4. WHEN deploying tested configurations THEN the system SHALL seamlessly promote them from test to production environments
5. IF configuration tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information and suggested fixes
