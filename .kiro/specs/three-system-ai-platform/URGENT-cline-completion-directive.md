## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Immediate Priority (Next 4 Hours)

1. **Focus on Task 7** - NeuroWeaver foundation is blocking multiple other tasks
2. **Complete backend structure** - FastAPI application with all required endpoints
3. **Set up Docker containers** - All services must be containerized and running
4. **Implement database models** - Complete schema and migrations

### Today's Deliverables (Next 12 Hours)

1. **Task 7 fully completed** - All NeuroWeaver components functional
2. **Begin Task 15** - Start tool communication system implementation
3. **Integration testing** - Verify NeuroWeaver integrates with existing auth
4. **Documentation updates** - Complete setup and usage documentation

### Quality Verification Steps

- All Docker containers build and run successfully
- All API endpoints respond correctly
- Frontend components render without errors
- Database migrations execute successfully
- Authentication works with existing JWT system
- Health checks return proper status
- TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### NeuroWeaver Integration Points

- **Authentication**: Must use unified JWT from Task 3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with separate schema
- **API Client**: TypeScript interfaces for all endpoints
- **Docker**: Integration with existing docker-compose.yml
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics endpoints

### Tool Communication Integration Points

- **Existing Systems**: AutoMatrix, RelayCore, NeuroWeaver
- **Error Handling**: Integration with error correlation system
- **Monitoring**: Connection to unified monitoring dashboard
- **Context**: Shared context with existing workflow system

## BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES

### Tasks Blocked by NeuroWeaver Setup (Task 7)

- Task 8: NeuroWeaver model registry implementation
- Task 9: NeuroWeaver-RelayCore performance monitoring
- Task 13: NeuroWeaver training pipeline
- All NeuroWeaver-related features and integrations

### Tasks Enhanced by Tool Communication (Task 15)

- Improved error resolution across all systems
- Autonomous operation without human intervention
- Better coordination between Amazon Q and Cline
- Enhanced debugging and quality assurance workflows

## ESCALATION WARNING

**If tasks are not completed within 24 hours:**

- NeuroWeaver integration will be delayed indefinitely
- Tool autonomy features will remain unavailable
- Project timeline will be significantly impacted
- Manual coordination overhead will continue

## SUPPORT RESOURCES

### Available Documentation

- Complete task specifications with technical details
- Existing code patterns in AutoMatrix and RelayCore
- Docker configuration examples
- Authentication system implementation
- Database schema patterns

### Integration Examples

- AutoMatrix backend structure: `backend/app/`
- RelayCore service structure: `systems/relaycore/src/`
- Existing Docker configuration: `docker-compose.yml`
- Authentication patterns: `backend/app/api/auth.py`

## COMPLETION REPORTING

Upon completion of each task, Cline must:

1. **Update task status** in main tasks.md file
2. **Provide working demonstration** of all components
3. **Document setup and usage** instructions
4. **Confirm integration** with existing systems
5. **Run all tests** and provide results
6. **Update delegation log** with completion details

---

**Cline**: These tasks are FOUNDATION CRITICAL for the entire three-system integration. Task 7 is blocking multiple other tasks and must be completed first. Focus on creating a solid, working foundation that other components can build upon. Quality and integration are essential.
