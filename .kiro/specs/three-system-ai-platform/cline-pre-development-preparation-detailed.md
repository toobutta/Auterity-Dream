# [CLINE-TASK] Pre-Development Preparation for Three-System Integration

## Task Overview
Perform comprehensive pre-development analysis and preparation for the AutoMatrix, RelayCore, and NeuroWeaver integration project. This includes dependency analysis, code structure validation, integration point identification, and preliminary setup tasks.

## Component Analysis Required

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface PreDevelopmentAnalysis {
  systems: {
    autmatrix: SystemAnalysis;
    relaycore: SystemAnalysis;
    neuroweaver: SystemAnalysis;
  };
  integrationPoints: IntegrationPoint[];
  dependencies: DependencyAnalysis;
  recommendations: PreparationRecommendation[];
}

interface SystemAnalysis {
  codebase: CodebaseHealth;
  dependencies: PackageAnalysis;
  apiEndpoints: EndpointInventory;
  authenticationStatus: AuthStatus;
  testCoverage: TestAnalysis;
}
```

## Specific Analysis Tasks

### 1. Codebase Health Assessment (2 hours)

**AutoMatrix Analysis:**
- Analyze `backend/app/` structure and identify integration readiness
- Review `frontend/src/` components for reusability in unified dashboard
- Check `backend/app/models/user.py` for RBAC compatibility
- Validate `backend/app/api/auth.py` for cross-system token support

**RelayCore Analysis:**
- Review `systems/relaycore/src/` structure completeness
- Analyze `systems/relaycore/src/services/provider-manager.ts` for NeuroWeaver integration
- Check `systems/relaycore/src/middleware/auth.ts` for unified auth compatibility
- Validate `systems/relaycore/src/routes/ai.ts` endpoint specifications

**NeuroWeaver Analysis:**
- Review recent changes to `systems/neuroweaver/backend/app/core/auth.py`
- Analyze `systems/neuroweaver/backend/app/api/models.py` for RelayCore registration
- Check `systems/neuroweaver/frontend/src/components/` for dashboard integration
- Validate `systems/neuroweaver/backend/app/services/relaycore_connector.py` implementation

### 2. Dependency Compatibility Check (1 hour)

**Package Analysis:**
- Compare Python dependencies across AutoMatrix and NeuroWeaver backends
- Analyze Node.js dependencies between AutoMatrix frontend and NeuroWeaver frontend
- Check for version conflicts in shared dependencies (FastAPI, React, TypeScript)
- Identify missing dependencies for cross-system communication

**Files to Analyze:**
- `backend/requirements.txt`
- `frontend/package.json`
- `systems/neuroweaver/backend/requirements.txt`
- `systems/neuroweaver/frontend/package.json`
- `systems/relaycore/package.json`

### 3. API Integration Point Mapping (1.5 hours)

**Cross-System Endpoints:**
- Map AutoMatrix workflow endpoints that need RelayCore routing
- Identify NeuroWeaver model endpoints for RelayCore registration
- Document authentication flow between all three systems
- Validate WebSocket connections for real-time updates

**Integration Points to Document:**
```typescript
interface IntegrationPoint {
  source: 'autmatrix' | 'relaycore' | 'neuroweaver';
  target: 'autmatrix' | 'relaycore' | 'neuroweaver';
  endpoint: string;
  method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';
  authentication: 'jwt' | 'cross-system-token' | 'api-key';
  dataFlow: 'request' | 'response' | 'bidirectional';
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
}
```

### 4. Database Schema Compatibility (1 hour)

**Schema Analysis:**
- Review `scripts/init-unified-db.sql` for completeness
- Check AutoMatrix models compatibility with shared schema
- Validate NeuroWeaver model registry schema
- Identify missing tables or relationships

**Files to Review:**
- `backend/app/models/` (all model files)
- `systems/neuroweaver/backend/app/models/` (if exists)
- `systems/relaycore/src/database/schema.sql`
- `backend/alembic/versions/` (latest migrations)

### 5. Authentication Flow Validation (1 hour)

**Auth System Analysis:**
- Compare authentication implementations across systems
- Validate JWT token compatibility
- Check cross-system token generation and validation
- Identify role-based access control gaps

**Key Files:**
- `backend/app/auth.py`
- `backend/app/api/auth.py`
- `systems/neuroweaver/backend/app/core/auth.py` (recently updated)
- `systems/relaycore/src/middleware/auth.ts`

### 6. Test Infrastructure Assessment (30 minutes)

**Testing Readiness:**
- Analyze existing test patterns across systems
- Identify integration test requirements
- Check test database setup for multi-system testing
- Validate mock implementations for cross-system calls

- Seamless AI request routing through RelayCore
- Specialized model deployment via NeuroWeaver
- Real-time monitoring and analytics

### Quality Requirements
- Zero breaking changes to existing AutoMatrix functionality
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage across all systems
- Ensure security compliance for cross-system communication
- Performance impact < 10% for existing workflows

## Files to Create/Modify

### Analysis Documents
- `.kiro/analysis/system-readiness-report.md`
- `.kiro/analysis/integration-architecture.md`
- `.kiro/analysis/dependency-analysis.md`

## Priority
High - Required before any integration development begins

## Estimated Time
6-7 hours total

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Review findings with Kiro for architectural decisions
2. Address critical blockers identified in analysis
3. Begin implementation of integration components
4. Set up continuous integration for three-system testing

## Notes
- Focus on identifying blockers early to prevent development delays
- Prioritize authentication and security analysis given recent auth module updates
- Pay special attention to RelayCore completion status as it's the integration hub
- Document all assumptions and recommendations clearly for development team
