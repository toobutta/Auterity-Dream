# AMAZON-Q-TASK: RelayCore Steering Rules Engine Implementation

## Task Overview

Implement and test the RelayCore steering rules engine with YAML-based routing rules parser, cost-aware model selection algorithm, and comprehensive testing.

## Context

- **Phase**: 2 - RelayCore Integration (Week 2)
- **Priority**: High - Blocks Phase 3 NeuroWeaver integration
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1-5 completed (security fixes, project structure, auth system, HTTP proxy, AutoMatrix integration)
- **Requirements**: 2.2, 2.3 from requirements.md

## Technical Specifications

### 1. YAML-Based Routing Rules Parser

**File**: `systems/relaycore/src/services/steering-rules.ts`

**Requirements**:

- Parse YAML configuration files for routing rules
- Validate rule syntax and logic
- Support dynamic rule reloading without server restart
- Handle rule conflicts and precedence

**Rule Structure**:

```yaml
routing_rules:
  - name: "automotive_specialist"
    conditions:
      - field: "context.domain"
        operator: "equals"
        value: "automotive"
    actions:
      - provider: "neuroweaver"
        model: "automotive-specialist-v1"
        priority: 1
  - name: "cost_optimization"
    conditions:
      - field: "cost_constraints.max_cost"
        operator: "less_than"
        value: 0.01
    actions:
      - provider: "openai"
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
        priority: 2
```

### 2. Cost-Aware Model Selection Algorithm

**File**: `systems/relaycore/src/services/cost-optimizer.ts` (already exists - enhance)

**Requirements**:

- Implement cost prediction based on token count estimation
- Dynamic model switching when budget constraints are hit
- Cost history tracking and trend analysis
- Integration with existing CostOptimizer class

**Algorithm Logic**:

1. Estimate request cost based on prompt length and model pricing
2. Check against user/organization budget limits
3. Apply cost optimization strategy (aggressive/balanced/quality_first)
4. Select optimal model balancing cost and quality requirements
5. Track actual costs and update predictions

### 3. Testing Framework

**Files**:

- `systems/relaycore/src/test/steering-rules.test.ts`
- `systems/relaycore/src/test/cost-optimizer.test.ts`

**Test Coverage Requirements**:

- Unit tests for rule parsing and validation (90% coverage)
- Integration tests for end-to-end routing decisions
- Performance tests for rule evaluation speed
- Edge case testing for malformed rules and extreme costs

## Implementation Requirements

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when rules are invalid
- Fallback to default routing when rule engine fails
- Comprehensive logging of rule evaluation decisions
- Alert system for rule conflicts or failures

### Performance Requirements

- Rule evaluation must complete within 50ms
- Support for 1000+ concurrent rule evaluations
- Memory usage under 100MB for rule engine
- Hot-reload of rules without performance impact

### Integration Points

- **AutoMatrix Integration**: Rules must work with existing AutoMatrix AI calls
- **NeuroWeaver Models**: Support for custom model registration and routing
- **Cost Tracking**: Integration with existing budget management system
- **Monitoring**: Metrics collection for rule effectiveness

## Quality Gates

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] YAML parser handles all specified rule formats
- [ ] Cost optimizer correctly predicts and manages budgets
- [ ] Rule conflicts are detected and resolved appropriately
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work when rules fail

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Rule evaluation latency < 50ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] Memory usage < 100MB under normal load
- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent evaluations
- [ ] Hot-reload completes within 5 seconds

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit test coverage >= 90%
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions covered

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All routing rules work correctly with various request patterns
2. **Performance**: Meets all latency and throughput requirements
3. **Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage with all tests passing
4. **Integration**: Seamless integration with AutoMatrix and NeuroWeaver
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples

## Handoff to Cline

Upon completion, Amazon Q should provide:

- Detailed implementation summary
- Performance benchmark results
- Integration test results
- Any architectural recommendations for Phase 3
- Specific guidance for NeuroWeaver model registration integration

## Estimated Completion

**Target**: 8-12 hours
**Priority**: High - Required for Phase 3 NeuroWeaver integration
