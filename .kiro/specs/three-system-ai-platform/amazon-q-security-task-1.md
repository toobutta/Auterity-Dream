# AMAZON-Q-TASK: Security Vulnerability Assessment and Fixes

## Task Assignment

**Assigned Tool**: Amazon Q (Claude 3.7)
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Task ID**: Phase 1, Task 1

## Task Overview

Perform comprehensive security vulnerability assessment and remediation across AutoMatrix, RelayCore, and NeuroWeaver codebases. This is a critical foundation task that must be completed before any integration work begins.

## Specific Requirements

Based on requirements 1.1 and 7.1 from the spec:

- **Requirement 1.1**: Tool delegation framework with Amazon Q handling security vulnerabilities automatically
- **Requirement 7.1**: Tool autonomy with Amazon Q taking responsibility for security fixes

## Scope Definition

### Systems to Analyze

1. **AutoMatrix** (Current codebase in this workspace)
   - Backend: FastAPI Python application
   - Frontend: React TypeScript application
   - Dependencies: All package.json and requirements.txt files
   - Configuration: Docker, environment files, CI/CD

2. **RelayCore** (Located in PRD/RelayCore/)
   - Backend services and proxy implementations
   - Cost-aware model switching components
   - Integration interfaces and APIs

3. **NeuroWeaver** (Located in PRD/TuneDev/)
   - Model training and deployment infrastructure
   - Frontend dashboard components
   - Specialized automotive AI components

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Vulnerability Scanning (1-2 hours)

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scan**
   - Scan all Python requirements.txt files for known vulnerabilities
   - Scan all package.json files for npm security issues
   - Check Docker base images for security updates
   - Identify outdated packages with security patches

2. **Code Security Analysis**
   - Review authentication and authorization implementations
   - Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
   - Analyze API endpoints for security weaknesses
   - Review environment variable handling and secrets management

3. **Configuration Security Review**
   - Examine Docker configurations for security best practices
   - Review CORS settings and API security headers
   - Check database connection security
   - Validate SSL/TLS configurations

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Classification (30 minutes)

1. **Severity Assessment**
   - Classify vulnerabilities as Critical/High/Moderate/Low
   - Prioritize fixes based on exploitability and impact
   - Document affected components and systems

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Determine which systems are affected by each vulnerability
   - Assess potential for cross-system exploitation
   - Identify dependencies between vulnerability fixes

### Phase 3: Security Fixes Implementation (2-3 hours)

1. **Immediate Fixes (Critical/High)**
   - Update vulnerable dependencies to secure versions
   - Patch authentication and authorization flaws
   - Fix SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
   - Secure API endpoints and data validation

2. **Moderate Severity Fixes**
   - Update packages with moderate security issues
   - Implement additional security headers
   - Strengthen input validation and sanitization
   - Improve error handling to prevent information disclosure

3. **Security Best Practices Implementation**
   - Add security middleware and request validation
   - Implement proper secrets management
   - Add security logging and monitoring
   - Configure secure defaults for all services

### Phase 4: Verification and Testing (1 hour)

1. **Security Testing**
   - Run automated security scans to verify fixes
   - Test authentication and authorization flows
   - Validate API security measures
   - Confirm no new vulnerabilities introduced

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Ensure security fixes don't break existing functionality
   - Test cross-system authentication flows
   - Validate API integrations still work correctly
   - Confirm Docker containers build and run properly

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero critical or high severity vulnerabilities remaining
- [ ] All moderate severity vulnerabilities addressed or documented with mitigation
- [ ] Security best practices implemented across all three systems
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work after security fixes
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation of changes and remaining risks

## Technical Context

### Current Known Issues

From the product overview, there are currently:

- 7 moderate vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies
- 500+ backend linting violations (may include security issues)
- Authentication system needs hardening

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Alembic migrations
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, custom AI service implementations

### File Locations

- **AutoMatrix Backend**: `backend/` directory
- **AutoMatrix Frontend**: `frontend/` directory
- **RelayCore**: `PRD/RelayCore/` directory
- **NeuroWeaver**: `PRD/TuneDev/` directory

## Deliverables

1. **Security Assessment Report**
   - Complete vulnerability scan results
   - Risk assessment and prioritization
   - Remediation plan and timeline

2. **Fixed Code**
   - Updated dependencies and configurations
   - Patched security vulnerabilities
   - Implemented security best practices

3. **Security Documentation**
   - Security implementation guide
   - Best practices for ongoing security
   - Monitoring and alerting recommendations

4. **Test Results**
   - Security scan results showing fixes
   - Functional test results confirming no regressions
   - Performance impact assessment

## Handoff Instructions

After completion:

1. Update task status to completed
2. Document all changes in security assessment report
3. Provide recommendations for ongoing security monitoring
4. Hand off to Cline for any follow-up development tasks that emerge

## Quality Gates

- All critical and high vulnerabilities must be fixed
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Security best practices documented and implemented
- Clean security scan results before task completion

This task is critical for the foundation of the three-system integration and must be completed successfully before proceeding to Phase 2 tasks.
