- ‚úÖ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ‚úÖ All unit tests passing with 90%+ coverage
- ‚úÖ Integration tests passing
- ‚úÖ Performance requirements met
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities resolved
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

### Success Criteria Verification
Each task has specific success criteria that MUST be met:
- **Task 6**: Rule evaluation < 50ms, 90% test coverage, integration with AutoMatrix
- **Task 11**: Error correlation >90% accuracy, <200ms API response, 67+ linting fixes
- **Task 14**: 25% cost reduction, <200ms API response, ML model >90% accuracy
- **Task 16**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, encryption implemented, compliance validated
- **Task 17**: <2% monitoring overhead, <3s dashboard load, 99.9% uptime

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Hours)
1. **Prioritize Task 11** - Fix critical code quality issues (67+ violations)
2. **Complete Task 6** - Unblock NeuroWeaver integration
3. **Address Task 16** - Resolve security vulnerabilities

### Today's Deliverables (Next 8 Hours)
1. **All linting violations fixed** across all Amazon Q files
2. **Task 6 and Task 11 completed** and tested
3. **Task 16 security issues resolved**
4. **Progress update on Tasks 14 and 17**

### Quality Verification
- Run automated tests on all completed tasks
- Validate integration with existing systems
- Confirm performance requirements met
- Document all changes and decisions

## ESCALATION WARNING

**If tasks are not completed within 24 hours:**
- Kiro will assume direct control of all Amazon Q responsibilities
- Credit exhaustion protocol may be activated
- Project timeline will be impacted
- Quality standards may be compromised

## SUPPORT RESOURCES

### Available Context
- All task specification files are complete and detailed
- Existing code patterns and integration points documented
- Success criteria and quality gates clearly defined
- Testing requirements and validation steps provided

### Integration Points
- AutoMatrix backend: `backend/app/`
- RelayCore service: `systems/relaycore/src/`
- NeuroWeaver backend: `systems/neuroweaver/backend/app/`
- Monitoring infrastructure: `monitoring/prometheus/`

## COMPLETION REPORTING

Upon completion of each task, Amazon Q must:
1. **Update task status** in main tasks.md file
2. **Document deliverables** and changes made
3. **Provide test results** and performance metrics
4. **Confirm integration** with existing systems
5. **Update delegation log** with completion details
