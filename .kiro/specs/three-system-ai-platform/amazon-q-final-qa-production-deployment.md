#### 4.2 Deployment Strategy

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment first
- **Database Migration**: Execute schema changes with rollback plan
- **Service Deployment Order**:
  1. Database and Redis services
  2. RelayCore (AI routing hub)
  3. NeuroWeaver backend services
  4. AutoMatrix backend
  5. Frontend applications
- **Health Check Validation**: Verify all services healthy before traffic routing

#### 4.3 Production Environment Setup
