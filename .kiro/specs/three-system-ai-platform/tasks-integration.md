## Tool Autonomy Rules

### Direct Tool Communication Protocol

- **Cline encounters error** â†’ Automatically hands off to Amazon Q with full context
- **Amazon Q provides solution** â†’ Directly instructs Cline on implementation
- **Tools iterate until success** â†’ Continue collaboration without human intervention
- **Escalate to Kiro only** â†’ When tools cannot resolve after 3 attempts

### Success Criteria

- **Zero Kiro involvement** in routine development tasks
- **Direct tool resolution** of 90%+ of issues
- **Automated handoffs** between Cline and Amazon Q
- **Full documentation** of all tool decisions and communications

### Quality Gates

- **All security vulnerabilities fixed** before proceeding to next phase
- **All tests passing** before deployment
- **Performance requirements met** for each integration
- **Documentation complete** for all implemented features
