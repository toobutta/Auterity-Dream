## Task Assignment

**Tool**: Amazon Q (Claude 3.7)
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Task Overview

Implement advanced cost optimization and performance tuning across the three-system AI platform (AutoMatrix, RelayCore, NeuroWeaver) with machine learning-based cost prediction and dynamic resource management.

## Requirements Reference

- **Requirement 2.3**: Cost optimization and intelligent model selection
- **Requirement 5.3**: Performance monitoring and optimization

## Implementation Specifications

### 1. Machine Learning Cost Prediction Model

**Objective**: Create ML model to predict and optimize costs across all AI requests

**Components to Implement**:

```typescript
// systems/relaycore/src/services/cost-predictor.ts
interface CostPredictionModel {
  predictCost(request: AIRequest): Promise<CostPrediction>;
  optimizeModelSelection(
    request: AIRequest,
    budget: Budget,
  ): Promise<ModelSelection>;
  updateModel(actualCost: number, prediction: CostPrediction): void;
}

interface CostPrediction {
  estimatedCost: number;
  confidence: number;
  recommendedModel: string;
  alternativeModels: ModelOption[];
}
```

**Training Data Sources**:

- Historical AI request costs from all three systems
- Model performance metrics (latency, accuracy, cost per token)
- Usage patterns and peak/off-peak pricing
- Budget constraints and cost thresholds

**ML Algorithm Requirements**:

- Use lightweight regression model (linear regression or decision tree)
- Real-time prediction capability (< 50ms response time)
- Continuous learning from actual cost data
- Feature engineering for request complexity, model type, time of day

### 2. Dynamic Pricing and Budget Management

**Objective**: Implement real-time budget management with automatic cost controls

**Components to Implement**:

```typescript
// systems/relaycore/src/services/budget-manager.ts
interface BudgetManager {
  checkBudget(userId: string, estimatedCost: number): Promise<BudgetStatus>;
  allocateBudget(request: AIRequest): Promise<BudgetAllocation>;
  enforceSpendingLimits(userId: string): Promise<SpendingAction>;
  generateCostReport(timeframe: TimeRange): Promise<CostReport>;
}

interface BudgetAllocation {
  approved: boolean;
  allocatedAmount: number;
  remainingBudget: number;
  recommendedAction: "proceed" | "downgrade" | "queue" | "reject";
}
```

**Budget Control Features**:

- Per-user daily/monthly spending limits
- Department-level budget allocation
- Automatic model downgrading when approaching limits
- Queue system for non-urgent requests when budget exhausted
- Real-time budget alerts and notifications

### 3. Database Query Optimization

**Objective**: Optimize database performance across all three systems

**AutoMatrix Database Optimizations**:

```sql
-- backend/database/optimizations.sql
-- Add indexes for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_workflows_user_created
ON workflows(user_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_executions_workflow_status
ON workflow_executions(workflow_id, status, created_at DESC);

-- Optimize workflow execution queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_executions_status_created
ON workflow_executions(status, created_at DESC)
WHERE status IN ('running', 'pending');
```

**RelayCore Database Optimizations**:

```sql
-- systems/relaycore/src/database/optimizations.sql
-- Optimize AI request logging and metrics
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_ai_requests_timestamp_model
ON ai_requests(timestamp DESC, model_used);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_cost_tracking_user_date
ON cost_tracking(user_id, date DESC);

-- Partitioning for large tables
CREATE TABLE ai_requests_2024_01 PARTITION OF ai_requests
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

**NeuroWeaver Database Optimizations**:

```sql
-- systems/neuroweaver/backend/database/optimizations.sql
-- Optimize model registry and performance tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_models_specialization_performance
ON models(specialization, performance_score DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_training_jobs_status_created
ON training_jobs(status, created_at DESC);
```

### 4. API Response Time Optimization

**Objective**: Reduce API response times across all systems to < 200ms average

**Caching Strategy Implementation**:

```typescript
// Shared caching service across all systems
interface CacheManager {
  get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null>;
  set<T>(key: string, value: T, ttl: number): Promise<void>;
  invalidate(pattern: string): Promise<void>;
  getStats(): Promise<CacheStats>;
}
```

**Response Time Optimizations**:

- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Add response compression (gzip) for large payloads
- Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization
- Implement connection pooling for database connections
- Add CDN for static assets in NeuroWeaver frontend

### 5. Performance Monitoring and Alerting

**Objective**: Real-time performance monitoring with automated optimization

**Components to Implement**:

```typescript
// Shared performance monitoring service
interface PerformanceMonitor {
  trackMetric(metric: PerformanceMetric): void;
  getMetrics(timeframe: TimeRange): Promise<MetricsSummary>;
  setAlert(condition: AlertCondition): Promise<AlertId>;
  optimizeAutomatically(
    trigger: OptimizationTrigger,
  ): Promise<OptimizationResult>;
}

interface PerformanceMetric {
  system: "autmatrix" | "relaycore" | "neuroweaver";
  type: "response_time" | "cost" | "accuracy" | "throughput";
  value: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```
