}
```

#### Health Check Implementation
```typescript
interface HealthCheckResponse {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  timestamp: string;
  uptime: number;
  version: string;
  dependencies: {
    database: { status: string; responseTime: number };
    redis: { status: string; responseTime: number };
    relaycore?: { status: string; responseTime: number };
    neuroweaver?: { status: string; responseTime: number };
  };
  metrics: {
    requestsPerMinute: number;
    errorRate: number;
    avgResponseTime: number;
  };
}
```

#### Distributed Tracing Setup
```typescript
// OpenTelemetry configuration for each service
const tracing = {
  serviceName: 'autmatrix-backend', // or 'relaycore', 'neuroweaver'
  jaegerEndpoint: 'http://jaeger:14268/api/traces',
  samplingRate: 0.1, // 10% sampling for production
  customAttributes: {
    'ai.model': string,
    'ai.cost': number,
    'ai.tokens': number,
    'user.id': string,
    'workflow.id': string
  }
};
```

### Docker Compose Integration

Update the existing docker-compose.yml to include:
- **Prometheus server** with proper configuration mounting
- **Grafana with provisioned dashboards** and data sources
- **Jaeger or Zipkin** for distributed tracing
- **AlertManager** for alert routing and notifications
- **Node Exporter, PostgreSQL Exporter, Redis Exporter** for system metrics

### Quality Assurance Requirements

#### Performance Standards
- **Metrics collection overhead** < 2% CPU impact per service
- **Health check response time** < 100ms for all endpoints

#### Reliability Standards
- **Monitoring system uptime** > 99.9%
- **Metrics retention** minimum 30 days, configurable up to 1 year
- **Alert false positive rate** < 5%
- **Trace sampling accuracy** maintains representative performance data

#### Security Standards
- **Metrics endpoints** protected by authentication
