# Requirements Document - Three-System AI Platform Integration

## Introduction

This spec defines the integration of AutoMatrix (workflow automation), RelayCore (AI routing hub), and TuneDev NeuroWeaver (model specialization) into a unified AI platform for automotive dealerships. The implementation will use maximum tool delegation with minimal Kiro involvement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tool Delegation Framework

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want maximum automation through tool delegation, so that development velocity is 10x faster with minimal human oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any security vulnerability is detected THEN Amazon Q SHALL automatically fix it without Kiro involvement
2. WHEN any development task is identified THEN Cline SHALL implement it autonomously with clear specifications
3. WHEN tools encounter conflicts THEN they SHALL attempt direct resolution before escalating to Kiro
4. WHEN Kiro credits are exhausted THEN Amazon Q SHALL assume all architectural responsibilities seamlessly

### Requirement 2: AutoMatrix-RelayCore Integration

**User Story:** As an AutoMatrix user, I want all AI calls to route through RelayCore, so that I get cost optimization and intelligent model selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AutoMatrix workflow executes AI step THEN it SHALL route through RelayCore HTTP proxy
2. WHEN RelayCore receives request THEN it SHALL apply steering rules for optimal model selection
3. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN RelayCore SHALL automatically switch to cheaper models
4. WHEN integration fails THEN system SHALL fallback to direct OpenAI calls with error logging

### Requirement 3: RelayCore-NeuroWeaver Integration

**User Story:** As a RelayCore administrator, I want access to NeuroWeaver's specialized models, so that automotive workflows get domain-optimized AI responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NeuroWeaver deploys new automotive model THEN RelayCore SHALL automatically register it for routing
2. WHEN RelayCore detects automotive context THEN it SHALL prefer NeuroWeaver specialized models
3. WHEN NeuroWeaver model performance degrades THEN RelayCore SHALL switch to backup models
4. WHEN usage patterns change THEN NeuroWeaver SHALL retrain models based on RelayCore analytics

### Requirement 4: Unified Authentication System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want single sign-on across all three platforms, so that users have seamless access without multiple logins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user logs into any system THEN they SHALL have access to all integrated systems
2. WHEN JWT token expires THEN it SHALL refresh automatically across all systems
3. WHEN user permissions change THEN updates SHALL propagate to all systems within 5 minutes
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN user SHALL receive clear error message with recovery steps

### Requirement 5: Cross-System Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want unified monitoring across all three systems, so that I can track performance and costs from a single dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system generates metrics THEN they SHALL be aggregated in unified dashboard
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN alerts SHALL be sent with system context
3. WHEN costs exceed budget THEN automatic cost optimization SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be correlated across all three systems for root cause analysis

### Requirement 6: Automated Deployment Pipeline

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment across all three systems, so that updates are coordinated and zero-downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed to any system THEN automated tests SHALL run across all affected systems
2. WHEN tests pass THEN deployment SHALL proceed automatically to staging environment
3. WHEN staging validation succeeds THEN production deployment SHALL be triggered with approval
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN automatic rollback SHALL restore previous stable state

### Requirement 7: Tool Autonomy and Direct Communication

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want tools to communicate directly and resolve issues autonomously, so that development continues without human bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Cline encounters build error THEN it SHALL automatically hand off to Amazon Q for debugging
2. WHEN Amazon Q identifies fix THEN it SHALL provide solution directly to Cline for implementation
3. WHEN tools iterate on solution THEN they SHALL continue until success criteria are met
4. WHEN tools cannot resolve issue THEN they SHALL escalate to Kiro with full context and attempted solutions
