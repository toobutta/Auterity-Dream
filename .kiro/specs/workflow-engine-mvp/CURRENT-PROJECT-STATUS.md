- 5 additional moderate severity issues

Action Required: npm audit fix with breaking change testing
```

### 2. Backend Code Quality Crisis - URGENT 🚨

Action Required: black, isort, flake8 cleanup
```

### 3. Test Infrastructure Problems - HIGH 🟡
```bash
Status: 35 failed tests out of 250 (14% failure rate)
Impact: BLOCKS CI/CD PIPELINE
Priority: HIGH - Fix after backend quality

Issues:
- JS heap out of memory errors
- Mock configuration problems
- Coverage reporting broken (vitest dependency conflicts)
- Inconsistent test patterns
