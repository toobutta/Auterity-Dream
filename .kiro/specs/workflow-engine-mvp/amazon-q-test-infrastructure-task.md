## üéØ TASK OVERVIEW

Diagnose and repair the test infrastructure crisis affecting 35 failed tests out of 250 total (14% failure rate) and resolve JS heap out of memory errors. This task leverages Amazon Q's advanced debugging capabilities to systematically fix test infrastructure issues and establish reliable CI/CD pipeline foundation.

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Test Infrastructure Crisis
```bash
Current Status: HIGH PRIORITY - Blocks reliable CI/CD pipeline
Impact: Unreliable development workflow, can't trust test results

Issue Breakdown:

npm audit
```

### Phase 2: Mock Configuration Analysis (60 minutes)
```bash
# Analyze mock patterns across test files
find src -name "*.test.tsx" -exec grep -l "mock\|Mock\|jest\|vi\." {} \;

# Check for missing mock exports
grep -r "Cannot find module" test_output.log

# Analyze API mocking consistency
grep -r "msw\|mockApi\|mock.*Api" src/components/__tests__/

# Component mocking patterns
grep -r "jest.mock\|vi.mock" src/components/__tests__/
```

### Phase 3: Systematic Resolution (120 minutes)
```bash

# - Optimize test configuration
# - Add proper cleanup in tests
# - Reduce memory footprint

# Step 2: Standardize mock configurations
# - Create consistent mock patterns
# - Fix missing mock exports
# - Standardize API mocking

# Step 3: Fix coverage reporting

## üîß TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Test File Scope Analysis
```bash
frontend/src/components/__tests__/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WorkflowExecutionResults.test.tsx    # 4 'any' violations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WorkflowErrorDisplay.test.tsx         # 7 'any' violations  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WorkflowExecutionInterface.test.tsx   # 5 'any' violations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ErrorReportModal.test.tsx            # Mock configuration issues
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other test files]                   # Various mock and memory issues
```

### Memory Optimization Strategy
```javascript
// Test configuration optimization
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: ['./src/setupTests.ts'],
    pool: 'forks', // Prevent memory leaks between tests
    poolOptions: {
      forks: {
        singleFork: true // Reduce memory usage
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Mock Standardization Pattern
```typescript
// Standardized mock pattern for all tests
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { rest } from 'msw';
import { server } from '../tests/mocks/server';

// Standard mock setup
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
});

afterEach(() => {
  server.resetHandlers();
});

// Standard API mock pattern
const mockApiResponse = {
  // Properly typed mock data
};

server.use(
  rest.get('/api/endpoint', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json(mockApiResponse));
  })
);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Areas
