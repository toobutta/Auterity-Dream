# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AutoMatrix AI Hub Workflow Engine MVP is a streamlined version of the full platform designed to demonstrate core workflow automation capabilities for automotive dealerships. This MVP focuses on the essential components needed to create, execute, and monitor simple AI-powered workflows without the complexity of full multi-tenancy, advanced integrations, or comprehensive role-based systems. The goal is to validate the core concept and gather user feedback as quickly as possible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dealership manager, I want to create simple AI workflows using a visual interface, so that I can automate basic customer interactions without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the workflow builder THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop canvas interface
2. WHEN a user drags workflow components onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow connecting them with visual connectors
3. WHEN a user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL persist the workflow configuration to the database
4. IF a workflow has missing required connections THEN the system SHALL display validation errors before saving

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dealership staff member, I want to execute workflows that can process customer inquiries using AI, so that I can provide consistent and intelligent responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is triggered THEN the system SHALL execute each step in the defined sequence
2. WHEN a workflow step requires AI processing THEN the system SHALL call the configured AI model (OpenAI GPT)
3. WHEN a workflow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return the final output to the user
4. IF a workflow step fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and stop execution with a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dealership manager, I want to monitor workflow executions and see basic analytics, so that I can understand how well the automation is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows are executed THEN the system SHALL log all execution details with timestamps
2. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display workflow execution history
3. WHEN viewing execution history THEN the system SHALL show success/failure rates and execution times
4. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL display the error details in the execution log

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic user authentication and workflow management, so that I can control access and organize workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the system THEN the system SHALL require valid login credentials
2. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create an authenticated session
3. WHEN an authenticated user creates workflows THEN the system SHALL associate workflows with their user account
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dealership staff member, I want to use pre-built workflow templates for common scenarios, so that I can quickly deploy automation without building from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the template library THEN the system SHALL display available workflow templates
2. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL create a new workflow based on the template
3. WHEN a template is instantiated THEN the system SHALL allow the user to customize parameters before saving
4. IF a template requires configuration THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for required values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have a simple API for workflow execution, so that workflows can be triggered from external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made to execute a workflow THEN the system SHALL authenticate the request
2. WHEN a valid workflow execution request is received THEN the system SHALL start the workflow and return an execution ID
3. WHEN an API client requests workflow status THEN the system SHALL return the current execution state
4. IF an invalid workflow ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
