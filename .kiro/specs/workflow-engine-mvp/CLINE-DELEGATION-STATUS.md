# For SECURITY FIXES
npm audit                    # Must return 0 vulnerabilities
npm run build               # Must succeed without errors
npm test                    # All tests must still pass

# For BACKEND QUALITY FIXES
cd backend && flake8 .      # Must return 0 violations
python -m pytest tests/    # All tests must still pass

# For TEST INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR
npm test                    # Must return 0 failed tests
