```

## Tool Communication Protocol

### Direct Tool Handoffs Enabled

Following the tool delegation guidelines, enable direct communication between tools:

#### Cline â†” Amazon Q Handoffs

- **Cline â†’ Amazon Q**: If project audit reveals infrastructure or deployment issues
- **Amazon Q â†’ Cline**: If architecture design requires code changes or optimizations

#### Communication Format

```markdown
## DIRECT HANDOFF: [TOOL] â†’ [TOOL]

**Context**: [Current task and findings]
**Handoff Reason**: [Why other tool is needed]
**Specific Request**: [Exact action needed]
**Success Criteria**: [How to verify completion]
**Return Conditions**: [When to hand back]
```

## Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria

- [ ] All critical bugs and linting issues resolved
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented
- [ ] Production architecture designed and validated
- [ ] Infrastructure templates tested and ready
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### Quality Gates

- [ ] 0 linting errors, 0 TypeScript warnings
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage maintained
- [ ] All accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security best practices implemented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Integration Complexity**: Error display integration with existing components
2. **Production Architecture**: AWS cost optimization and security compliance
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Coordinating multiple tool outputs

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incremental Integration**: Test each component independently before integration
2. **Architecture Review**: Validate AWS design with team before implementation
3. **Parallel Execution**: Run tasks in parallel where possible to reduce timeline

## Post-Delegation Actions

### After CLINE-TASK-3 (Project Audit)

1. Review audit findings with development team
2. Prioritize critical issues for immediate fix
3. Plan dependency updates and security patches
4. Update development processes based on recommendations

### After CLINE-TASK-4 (Error Display)

1. Integration testing with existing execution interface
2. User acceptance testing for error scenarios
3. Documentation update for error handling procedures
4. Training team on new error reporting features

### After AMAZON-Q-TASK-1 (Production Architecture)

1. Architecture review with DevOps team
2. Cost estimate validation and budget approval
3. Infrastructure deployment to staging environment
4. Production deployment planning and scheduling

## Next Phase Planning

### Immediate Next Steps (Post-MVP)

1. **User Feedback Integration**: Collect and analyze user feedback
2. **Performance Optimization**: Based on production metrics
3. **Feature Enhancements**: Advanced workflow capabilities
4. **Integration Expansion**: Additional third-party integrations

### Future Spec Candidates

1. **Advanced Workflow Features**: Conditional logic, loops, parallel execution
2. **Integration Hub**: CRM, DMS, and third-party service integrations
3. **Analytics & Reporting**: Advanced analytics and business intelligence
4. **Mobile Application**: Mobile app for workflow monitoring and execution
5. **API Gateway**: Public API for third-party integrations

## Team Coordination

### Development Team Queue

```
Current Priority Queue:
1. Monitor delegated task progress
2. Prepare for integration testing
3. Plan production deployment
4. Begin next spec planning

Upcoming Work:
1. New spec requirements gathering
2. Advanced feature planning
3. User feedback integration
4. Performance optimization
```

### Communication Plan

- **Daily Standups**: Review delegation progress
- **Weekly Reviews**: Assess completed deliverables
- **Integration Sessions**: Test and integrate completed components
- **Planning Sessions**: Define next phase requirements
