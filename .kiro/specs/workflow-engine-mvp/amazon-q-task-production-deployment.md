2. Cost-benefit analysis
3. Integration complexity
4. Feature comparison for workflow monitoring
```

### 6. Cost Optimization Strategy

#### Resource Sizing
```yaml
# Cost optimization recommendations:
1. Right-sizing EC2 instances/Fargate tasks
2. Reserved Instance vs On-Demand strategy
3. Spot Instance opportunities
4. Database instance optimization
5. Storage optimization (EBS, S3)
```

#### Cost Monitoring
```yaml
# Cost management setup:
1. AWS Cost Explorer configuration
2. Budget alerts and thresholds
3. Resource tagging strategy
4. Cost allocation by environment/feature
```
