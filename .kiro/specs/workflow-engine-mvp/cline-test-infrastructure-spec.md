# [CLINE-TASK] Test Infrastructure Repair

## Task Overview

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ HIGH - TEST INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Recommended Model**: Cerebras Qwen-3-32b
**Status**: Ready for Assignment After Security Fixes

## Objective

Fix 35 failed tests and resolve memory issues that are preventing reliable test execution and coverage reporting.

## Critical Test Issues

### Test Failure Statistics

```
Total Tests: 250
Passed: 206 (82.4%)
Failed: 35 (14.0%)
Errors: 1 memory error (JS heap out of memory)
```

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Memory Issues**: JS heap out of memory during test execution
2. **Mock Configuration**: Missing mock exports causing test failures
3. **API Integration**: Inconsistent mock setup across test files
4. **Component Integration**: Mock mismatches in integration tests
5. **Coverage Dependency**: vitest coverage plugin incompatible with current version

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Memory Issue Resolution

```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit for tests
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
npm test
```

### Phase 2: Mock Configuration Fixes

1. **Standardize mock setup** across all test files
2. **Fix missing mock exports** causing import failures
3. **Ensure consistent API mocking** patterns
4. **Update mock data** to match current interfaces

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Infrastructure

1. **Resolve vitest coverage dependency conflicts**
2. **Update test configuration** for reliable coverage
3. **Fix coverage reporting** pipeline

## Files to Fix (Priority Order)

### Critical Test Files (High failure rate)

- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/WorkflowExecutionResults.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/ErrorReportModal.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/WorkflowErrorDisplay.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/PerformanceDashboard.test.tsx`

### Mock Configuration Files

- Test setup files with mock configurations
- API mock files with inconsistent exports
- Component test files with integration issues

### Configuration Files

- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `frontend/package.json` - Test dependencies
- `frontend/vitest.config.ts` - Coverage configuration

## Specific Fixes Required

### Mock Export Issues

```typescript
// Fix missing mock exports like:
export const mockWorkflowsApi = {
  getExecution: vi.fn(),
  getExecutionLogs: vi.fn(),
  // ... other methods
};
```

### Memory Optimization

```typescript
// Add proper cleanup in tests:
afterEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  cleanup();
});
```

### Coverage Dependency Resolution

```json
// Update package.json with compatible versions:
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^1.0.0",
    "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

- âœ… All 250 tests pass (0 failures)
- âœ… No memory errors during test execution
- âœ… Test coverage reporting works
- âœ… Consistent mock setup across all tests
- âœ… Fast and reliable test execution
- âœ… Coverage reports generate successfully

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental Fixes**: Fix one test file at a time
- **Memory Monitoring**: Watch for memory usage during fixes
- **Mock Consistency**: Ensure all mocks follow same patterns
- **Regression Testing**: Run full suite after each fix

## Quality Standards

- **Test Reliability**: Tests must pass consistently
- **Mock Quality**: Mocks must accurately represent real APIs
- **Coverage Accuracy**: Coverage reports must be meaningful
- **Performance**: Tests should run in reasonable time

**This task is HIGH PRIORITY for development workflow and CI/CD pipeline reliability.**
