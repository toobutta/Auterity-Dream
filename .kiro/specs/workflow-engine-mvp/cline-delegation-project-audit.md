- **Model**: Cerebras Qwen-3-32b
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium - Analysis and documentation
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Status**: READY FOR IMMEDIATE DELEGATION

## Task Overview
Perform comprehensive project health audit focusing on dependencies, TypeScript compliance, test coverage, and code quality across the AutoMatrix AI Hub codebase.

## Audit Scope

### 1. Dependency Analysis

#### Frontend Dependencies Audit
```bash
# Tasks for Cline:
1. Analyze package.json for missing dependencies
2. Check for version conflicts and security vulnerabilities
3. Identify unused dependencies
4. Recommend dependency updates
5. Calculate bundle size impact of current dependencies
```

#### Backend Dependencies Audit
```bash
# Tasks for Cline:
1. Analyze requirements.txt for security issues
2. Check for outdated Python packages
3. Identify missing development dependencies
4. Recommend version updates with compatibility check
```

### 2. TypeScript Compliance Check

#### Frontend TypeScript Issues
```typescript
// Areas to audit:
1. Compilation errors and warnings
2. Usage of 'any' types (should be minimal)
3. Missing type definitions
4. Inconsistent type usage
5. Import/export type issues
```

#### Type Definition Completeness
```typescript
// Check these type files:
1. frontend/src/types/workflow.ts - Workflow-related types
2. frontend/src/api/workflows.d.ts - API response types
3. Component prop interfaces consistency
4. Missing type declarations for third-party libraries
```

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis

#### Frontend Test Coverage
```bash
# Analyze test coverage:
1. Run npm test -- --coverage to get current coverage
2. Identify components with low/no test coverage
3. Find missing test scenarios (error cases, edge cases)
4. Check test quality and reliability
```

#### Backend Test Coverage
```bash
# Analyze backend tests:
1. Check pytest coverage reports
2. Identify untested API endpoints
3. Find missing integration tests
4. Validate test data and mocking strategies
```

### 4. Code Quality Assessment

#### Frontend Code Quality
```typescript
// Areas to check:
1. ESLint warnings and errors
2. Prettier formatting consistency
3. Component structure and patterns
4. Performance anti-patterns
5. Accessibility compliance
```

#### Backend Code Quality
```python
# Areas to check:
1. Flake8 linting issues
2. Black formatting compliance
3. Import organization (isort)
4. Async/await usage patterns
5. Error handling consistency
```

## Specific Analysis Tasks

### Task 1: Missing Dependencies Identification
```bash
# Check for these common issues:
1. Components using libraries not in package.json
2. Import statements for non-existent packages
3. Type definitions missing for JavaScript libraries
4. Development dependencies in production code
```

### Task 2: Security Vulnerability Scan
```bash
# Security checks:
1. npm audit for frontend vulnerabilities
2. pip-audit for backend vulnerabilities (if available)
3. Outdated package identification
4. Known security issues in current versions
```

### Task 3: Bundle Size Analysis
```bash
# Frontend bundle analysis:
1. Current bundle size after build
2. Largest dependencies by size
3. Unused code identification
4. Tree-shaking effectiveness
5. Code splitting opportunities
```

### Task 4: Performance Issues Identification
```typescript
// Performance audit areas:
1. Unnecessary re-renders in React components
2. Missing memoization opportunities
3. Large object/array operations
4. Inefficient API calls
5. Memory leak potential
```

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Dependency Report
```markdown
# Dependency Audit Report

## Missing Dependencies
- List of used but not declared dependencies
- Recommended additions with versions

## Security Issues
- Vulnerable packages with severity levels
- Recommended updates or alternatives

## Unused Dependencies
- Packages that can be safely removed
- Estimated bundle size reduction

## Version Conflicts
- Conflicting dependency versions
- Resolution recommendations
```

### 2. TypeScript Compliance Report
```typescript
// TypeScript Issues Summary
interface TypeScriptAudit {
  compilationErrors: CompilationError[];
  anyTypeUsage: AnyTypeUsage[];
  missingTypes: MissingTypeDefinition[];
  recommendations: TypeScriptRecommendation[];
}
```

### 3. Test Coverage Report
```markdown
# Test Coverage Analysis

## Current Coverage

- Per-component coverage breakdown
- Critical untested areas

## Missing Tests
- Components without tests
- API endpoints without tests
- Error scenarios not covered

## Test Quality Issues
- Flaky or unreliable tests
- Tests with poor assertions
- Missing integration tests
```

### 4. Code Quality Report
```markdown
# Code Quality Assessment

## Linting Issues
- ESLint/Flake8 warnings and errors
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Import organization issues

## Performance Issues
- Identified performance anti-patterns
- Memory usage concerns
- Bundle size optimization opportunities

## Accessibility Issues
- Missing ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation problems
- Color contrast issues
```

## Files to Analyze

### Frontend Files
```bash
# Key files to audit:
1. package.json - Dependencies and scripts
2. tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
3. src/**/*.tsx - Component implementations
4. src/**/*.test.tsx - Test files
5. src/types/*.ts - Type definitions
```

### Backend Files
```bash
# Key files to audit:
1. requirements.txt - Python dependencies
2. pyproject.toml - Project configuration
3. app/**/*.py - Application code
4. tests/**/*.py - Test files
5. alembic/ - Database migrations
```

### Configuration Files
```bash
# Configuration to check:

2. .flake8 - Python linting
3. vite.config.ts - Build configuration
4. docker-compose.yml - Development environment
```

## Automated Checks to Run

### Frontend Checks
```bash
# Commands for Cline to execute:
1. npm run lint - Check linting issues
2. npm run type-check - TypeScript compilation
3. npm test -- --coverage - Test coverage
4. npm run build - Build analysis
