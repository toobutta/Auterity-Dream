# [AMAZON-Q] Project Health Audit & Quality Analysis

## DIRECT HANDOFF: KIRO â†’ AMAZON Q

**Context:** Comprehensive project health audit for AutoMatrix AI Hub workflow engine
**Handoff Reason:** Amazon Q's expertise in QA, debugging, and code analysis is ideal for this audit task
**Current State:** Initial analysis started, found linting errors and security vulnerabilities
**Specific Request:** Complete comprehensive project health audit with actionable recommendations
**Success Criteria:** Detailed audit report with prioritized improvement recommendations
**Return Conditions:** When audit is complete and recommendations are documented

**Files Involved:**
- frontend/package.json - Frontend dependencies
- backend/requirements.txt - Backend dependencies  
- All TypeScript files in frontend/src/
- All Python files in backend/app/
- Configuration files (.eslintrc.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## Task Overview
Perform comprehensive project health audit focusing on dependencies, TypeScript compliance, test coverage, and code quality across the AutoMatrix AI Hub codebase.

## Initial Findings to Build Upon
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 7 moderate severity issues in frontend (esbuild, prismjs)
- **Linting Issues**: 19 problems (15 errors, 4 warnings) including:
  - Unused variables and imports
  - TypeScript `any` types in test files
  - React Hook dependency issues
- **TypeScript Version**: Running unsupported TypeScript 5.8.3 (supported: >=4.3.5 <5.4.0)

## Audit Scope

### 1. Dependency Analysis
- **Frontend**: Analyze package.json for missing, unused, and vulnerable dependencies
- **Backend**: Analyze requirements.txt for security issues and outdated packages
- **Version Conflicts**: Identify conflicting dependency versions
- **Bundle Size**: Calculate current bundle size and optimization opportunities

### 2. Security Vulnerability Assessment
- **Frontend**: Complete npm audit analysis with fix recommendations
- **Backend**: Python package security scan (pip-audit if available)
- **Severity Classification**: Categorize vulnerabilities by risk level
- **Fix Strategy**: Provide specific update paths and alternatives

### 3. TypeScript Compliance Check
- **Compilation Issues**: Identify all TypeScript errors and warnings
- **Type Safety**: Find usage of `any` types and missing type definitions
- **Configuration**: Review tsconfig.json for optimal settings
- **Import/Export**: Check for type import/export consistency

### 4. Code Quality Assessment
- **Linting**: Complete ESLint analysis with fix recommendations
- **Formatting**: Check Prettier/Black formatting consistency
- **Performance**: Identify React performance anti-patterns
- **Accessibility**: Check for ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Error Handling**: Assess error handling patterns and consistency

### 5. Test Coverage Analysis
- **Frontend**: Run test coverage analysis and identify gaps
- **Backend**: Analyze pytest coverage and missing test scenarios
- **Test Quality**: Assess test reliability and assertion quality
- **Integration Tests**: Check for missing end-to-end test coverage

## Automated Checks to Execute

### Frontend Commands
```bash
cd frontend
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test -- --coverage --run
npx tsc --noEmit  # Type checking
```

### Backend Commands  
```bash
cd backend
pip list --outdated
flake8 . --count --statistics
black --check .
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Executive Summary
- Overall project health score (1-10)
- Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- High-priority recommendations
- Risk assessment for production deployment

### 2. Detailed Audit Report
