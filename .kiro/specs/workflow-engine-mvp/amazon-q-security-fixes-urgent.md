# Amazon Q Task: URGENT Security Vulnerability Fixes

## DIRECT HANDOFF: KIRO → AMAZON Q

**Context:** Critical security vulnerabilities blocking all development work
**Handoff Reason:** Security vulnerability analysis and resolution requires Amazon Q expertise
**Current State:** 3 moderate security vulnerabilities identified in frontend dependencies
**Specific Request:** Analyze and fix all security vulnerabilities without breaking functionality
**Success Criteria:** Zero moderate or high security vulnerabilities in npm audit
**Return Conditions:** When all security vulnerabilities are resolved and components tested

**Files Involved:**

- frontend/package.json
- frontend/src/components/LazyCodeHighlighter.tsx
- All components using react-syntax-highlighter

**Priority:** CRITICAL - HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## Task Specification

### Objective

Fix all moderate and high security vulnerabilities in the frontend dependencies while maintaining full functionality of syntax highlighting components.

### Current Security Issues

#### 1. PrismJS DOM Clobbering Vulnerability

- **Package**: prismjs <1.30.0
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Advisory**: GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg
- **Dependency Chain**: react-syntax-highlighter@15.6.1 → refractor@3.6.0 → prismjs@1.27.0
- **Issue**: DOM Clobbering vulnerability in PrismJS versions before 1.30.0

#### 2. Esbuild Vulnerability (RESOLVED)

- **Package**: esbuild ≤0.24.2
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - vite@7.0.6 already installed
- **Verification Required**: Confirm no esbuild vulnerabilities remain

### Technical Analysis Required

#### Dependency Chain Analysis

```
react-syntax-highlighter@15.6.1
├── prismjs@1.30.0 (direct dependency - SAFE)
└── refractor@3.6.0
    └── prismjs@1.27.0 (vulnerable - NEEDS FIX)
```

#### Root Cause

The issue is that `refractor@3.6.0` depends on an older version of `prismjs@1.27.0` which has the DOM Clobbering vulnerability, even though `react-syntax-highlighter` also has a direct dependency on the safe `prismjs@1.30.0`.

### Required Actions

#### 1. Dependency Resolution Strategy

- **Option A**: Force update refractor to latest version that uses prismjs@1.30.0+
- **Option B**: Use npm overrides to force prismjs@1.30.0+ throughout dependency tree
- **Option C**: Find alternative syntax highlighting solution if breaking changes are too severe

#### 2. Component Impact Assessment

Analyze all components using react-syntax-highlighter:

- `frontend/src/components/LazyCodeHighlighter.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ExecutionLogViewer.tsx`
- Any other components importing react-syntax-highlighter

#### 3. Breaking Change Analysis

- Test all syntax highlighting functionality after updates
- Verify language support remains intact
- Check theme compatibility
- Validate performance impact

#### 4. Testing Requirements

- Run full test suite after dependency updates
- Manual testing of syntax highlighting components
- Verify no runtime errors in browser console
- Check bundle size impact

### Success Criteria

#### Security Requirements

- [ ] Zero moderate or high security vulnerabilities in `npm audit`
- [ ] All dependency chains use secure versions
- [ ] No new vulnerabilities introduced

#### Functionality Requirements

- [ ] All syntax highlighting components work correctly
- [ ] No breaking changes in component APIs
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No runtime errors or console warnings

#### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Bundle size impact < 10% increase
- [ ] Syntax highlighting performance maintained
- [ ] No memory leaks introduced

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Analysis

1. Run detailed vulnerability analysis with `npm audit --json`
2. Analyze dependency tree with `npm ls prismjs`
3. Research latest versions of refractor and react-syntax-highlighter
4. Identify safest upgrade path

#### Phase 2: Resolution

1. Implement chosen dependency resolution strategy
2. Update package.json with secure versions
3. Test for breaking changes in syntax highlighting
4. Update component code if necessary

#### Phase 3: Validation

1. Run `npm audit` to verify zero vulnerabilities
2. Execute full test suite
3. Manual testing of all syntax highlighting features
4. Performance validation

### Handback Conditions

#### Ready for Return to Development

- All security vulnerabilities resolved (npm audit clean)
- All tests passing
- All syntax highlighting components functional
- Documentation updated if breaking changes occurred

#### Escalation Triggers

- Breaking changes require architectural decisions
- Alternative solutions needed (different syntax highlighting library)
- Performance impact exceeds acceptable thresholds
- Timeline exceeds 4 hours

### Context for Amazon Q

#### Project Background

- React 18 + TypeScript frontend with Vite build system
- Syntax highlighting used for code display in workflow execution logs
- Critical path: Security fixes must complete before other development work

#### Code Patterns

- Components use lazy loading for performance
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vitest for testing

#### Quality Standards

- Zero tolerance for security vulnerabilities
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- No breaking changes without explicit approval
- Performance regression < 10%

### Expected Deliverables

1. **Security Resolution**: All vulnerabilities fixed
2. **Test Results**: Full test suite passing
3. **Component Validation**: All syntax highlighting working
4. **Documentation**: Summary of changes made
5. **Recommendations**: Prevention strategies for future

This task is critical for project security and must be completed before any other development work can proceed.
