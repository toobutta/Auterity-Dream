# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Optimized AI Workflow Strategy transforms the Auterity Unified AI Platform development approach by implementing a sophisticated multi-tool orchestration system that maximizes the strengths of Amazon Q, Cursor IDE, and Cline while minimizing coordination overhead. This strategy creates autonomous development blocks where each AI tool can execute complete project phases independently, with strategic checkpoints for integration and quality assurance.

The system addresses the current challenge of managing complex interdependencies across three major systems (AutoMatrix, NeuroWeaver, RelayCore) while maintaining high code quality, security standards, and rapid development velocity. By creating clear tool specialization boundaries and autonomous execution blocks, the strategy enables parallel development streams that can operate independently while maintaining system coherence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want AI tools to execute complete development blocks autonomously with minimal coordination overhead, so that development velocity is maximized while maintaining quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a development block is assigned to a tool THEN the tool SHALL have complete autonomy to execute all tasks within that block without requiring approval for individual decisions
2. WHEN a tool completes a development block THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger quality assurance checkpoints and integration validation
3. WHEN multiple tools are working in parallel THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts through clear boundary definitions and shared resource management
4. WHEN a tool encounters a blocker THEN the system SHALL provide escalation paths that maintain development momentum
5. IF a development block requires cross-tool coordination THEN the system SHALL provide standardized handoff protocols and shared context management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development tool (Amazon Q, Cursor, Cline), I want clear specialization boundaries and autonomous execution authority, so that I can deliver optimal results within my expertise domain without coordination delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigned a task within my specialization THEN I SHALL have full authority to make implementation decisions and execute without approval
2. WHEN my expertise is required by another tool THEN the system SHALL provide direct communication channels and context sharing
3. WHEN I complete a development block THEN the system SHALL automatically validate my deliverables against predefined quality gates
4. WHEN I encounter issues outside my specialization THEN the system SHALL provide immediate access to the appropriate specialist tool
5. IF quality gates fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback and allow autonomous remediation within my authority

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance system, I want automated checkpoints and validation gates between development blocks, so that integration issues are caught early and system coherence is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a development block is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically execute comprehensive quality validation including security, performance, and integration tests
2. WHEN quality gates pass THEN the system SHALL automatically merge changes and trigger dependent development blocks
3. WHEN quality gates fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback and block progression until issues are resolved
4. WHEN multiple blocks are ready for integration THEN the system SHALL coordinate integration testing and conflict resolution
5. IF integration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide automated resolution suggestions and escalation to appropriate tools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want development blocks to be designed for maximum parallelization and minimal dependencies, so that development velocity is optimized and bottlenecks are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning development phases THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for parallel execution and minimize sequential dependencies
2. WHEN creating development blocks THEN the system SHALL ensure each block has clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria
3. WHEN blocks have dependencies THEN the system SHALL create shared interfaces and contracts that allow independent development
4. WHEN parallel blocks are executing THEN the system SHALL monitor progress and automatically rebalance workload if bottlenecks occur
5. IF dependencies change during execution THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust block definitions and notify affected tools

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want predictable delivery timelines and transparent progress visibility across all development streams, so that I can make informed decisions and manage expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development blocks are planned THEN the system SHALL provide accurate time estimates based on tool capabilities and historical performance
2. WHEN development is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time visibility into block completion status and overall project health
3. WHEN milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically generate progress reports and update stakeholders
4. WHEN risks or delays are identified THEN the system SHALL provide early warning and mitigation options
5. IF scope changes are requested THEN the system SHALL automatically assess impact on timeline and resource allocation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security and compliance officer, I want automated security validation and compliance checking integrated into every development block, so that security standards are maintained without slowing development velocity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically execute security scans and vulnerability assessments
2. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert the appropriate tool and block progression until resolved
3. WHEN compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL automatically update validation criteria and notify all active development blocks
4. WHEN security fixes are implemented THEN the system SHALL validate the fix and automatically propagate to all affected systems
5. IF critical security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL immediately halt all related development and trigger emergency response protocols

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want continuous performance monitoring and optimization integrated into the development workflow, so that performance regressions are prevented and system efficiency is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development blocks are executed THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor performance metrics and resource utilization
2. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically alert the responsible tool and provide optimization recommendations
3. WHEN performance improvements are implemented THEN the system SHALL validate the improvement and update performance baselines
4. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale resources and rebalance development workload
5. IF performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis and optimization strategies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an integration specialist, I want seamless integration between development blocks and systems, so that the final product operates as a cohesive platform despite being developed in parallel streams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development blocks interface with each other THEN the system SHALL enforce API contracts and data format standards
2. WHEN integration points are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically validate all dependent systems and notify affected development blocks
3. WHEN cross-system features are developed THEN the system SHALL coordinate between tools to ensure consistent implementation
4. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive validation of all system interactions
5. IF integration failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and coordinate resolution between affected tools
