# Test Infrastructure Dependency Repair Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for repairing the test infrastructure that is currently experiencing complete failure due to vitest module resolution errors. The system has 22 unhandled module resolution errors preventing all 250 tests from executing, which is blocking quality assurance and continuous integration processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Resolution Repair

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test modules to resolve correctly, so that I can run the test suite without dependency errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL resolve all vitest dependencies without module resolution errors
2. WHEN pretty-format module is accessed THEN the system SHALL find the correct module path in @vitest/snapshot dependencies
3. WHEN test files are loaded THEN the system SHALL successfully import all required testing utilities
4. WHEN module paths are resolved THEN the system SHALL use consistent path resolution across all test files
5. IF module resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific missing dependency

### Requirement 2: Vitest Configuration Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vitest configuration to be properly optimized for the project structure, so that tests run efficiently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vitest configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use correct module resolution strategies for the project structure
2. WHEN test files are discovered THEN the system SHALL find all test files in the expected locations
3. WHEN dependencies are resolved THEN the system SHALL use appropriate module resolution algorithms
4. WHEN test environment is set up THEN the system SHALL configure jsdom or node environment correctly
5. WHEN coverage is calculated THEN the system SHALL include all relevant source files and exclude test files

### Requirement 3: Dependency Chain Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test dependencies to be properly installed and compatible, so that the test infrastructure is stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package dependencies are checked THEN the system SHALL verify all testing dependencies are installed with compatible versions
2. WHEN peer dependencies are validated THEN the system SHALL ensure no version conflicts exist in the dependency tree
3. WHEN transitive dependencies are resolved THEN the system SHALL use consistent versions across all packages
4. WHEN dependency updates are needed THEN the system SHALL identify and update incompatible packages
5. WHEN lockfile is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure deterministic dependency resolution

### Requirement 4: Test Execution Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all 250 tests to be discoverable and executable, so that I can verify code quality and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test discovery runs THEN the system SHALL find all 250 test files without errors
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run all tests without module resolution failures
3. WHEN test results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide accurate pass/fail status for each test
4. WHEN test coverage is calculated THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports for all source files
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate status codes for CI/CD integration

### Requirement 5: Memory Management Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test infrastructure to manage memory efficiently, so that tests can run without out-of-memory errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL use the configured NODE_OPTIONS for memory allocation
2. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL stay within the 4GB limit specified in package.json
3. WHEN test isolation is needed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources between tests
4. WHEN large test suites run THEN the system SHALL use efficient memory management to prevent crashes
5. WHEN parallel execution occurs THEN the system SHALL balance memory usage across worker processes

### Requirement 6: CI/CD Integration Compatibility

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the test infrastructure to work reliably in CI/CD environments, so that automated testing can catch issues before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL execute without environment-specific failures
2. WHEN test results are reported THEN the system SHALL generate JUnit XML or similar formats for CI integration
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN test timeouts happen THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without hanging the CI process
5. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL produce coverage reports and test results in expected formats

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run tests during development with watch mode and fast feedback, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN watch mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL re-run relevant tests when files change
2. WHEN test feedback is needed THEN the system SHALL provide results within 10 seconds for individual test files
3. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL support debugging integration with IDEs
4. WHEN test filtering is used THEN the system SHALL allow running specific test files or patterns
5. WHEN test output is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear, readable results with proper formatting

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error reporting when tests fail, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN module resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with suggested fixes
2. WHEN test execution errors occur THEN the system SHALL show stack traces with source map support
3. WHEN configuration issues exist THEN the system SHALL validate configuration and report specific problems
4. WHEN dependency conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL identify conflicting packages and versions
5. WHEN debugging information is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options

## Success Metrics

- **Test Execution Rate**: 100% of tests discoverable and executable (currently 0%)
- **Module Resolution**: 0 module resolution errors (currently 22)
- **Test Performance**: <30 seconds for full test suite execution
- **Memory Efficiency**: Tests complete within 4GB memory limit
- **CI/CD Reliability**: 100% success rate in automated test execution

## Technical Constraints

- **Node.js Version**: Must work with current Node.js version in use
- **Package Manager**: Must be compatible with npm and existing package-lock.json
- **Memory Limits**: Must respect NODE_OPTIONS memory configuration
- **File Structure**: Must work with existing test file organization
- **Build Integration**: Must integrate with existing Vite build system

## Dependencies

- **Security Fixes**: ✅ Completed (No security vulnerabilities blocking test execution)
- **Backend Quality**: ✅ Completed (Backend tests should be working)
- **Node.js Environment**: Current Node.js installation must be compatible
- **Package Dependencies**: All test-related packages must be properly installed
- **Build System**: Vite configuration must be compatible with test setup

## Risk Mitigation

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Use npm ls to identify and resolve version conflicts
- **Configuration Issues**: Validate vitest configuration against known working setups
- **Environment Differences**: Test in multiple environments to ensure consistency
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain backup of working configuration if available
- **Incremental Fixes**: Fix module resolution issues one at a time to isolate problems

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the current issue description:

- **Primary Issue**: Cannot find module 'pretty-format/build/index.js' in @vitest/snapshot dependencies
- **Impact**: Complete test infrastructure failure - zero tests can execute
- **Scope**: 22 unhandled vitest module resolution errors
- **Urgency**: Critical - blocking all quality assurance processes

## Investigation Areas

1. **@vitest/snapshot Package**: Verify installation and internal structure
2. **pretty-format Dependency**: Check if properly installed and accessible
3. **Module Resolution Strategy**: Review vitest configuration for module resolution
4. **Package Lock Consistency**: Ensure package-lock.json matches package.json
5. **Node Modules Structure**: Verify node_modules directory structure is correct
