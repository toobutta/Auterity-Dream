# RelayCore Admin Interface Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for building the RelayCore admin interface, which will provide administrators with comprehensive control over AI routing, cost analytics, and steering rules management. This interface will leverage the completed shared foundation components and design tokens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Routing Dashboard

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing AI routing metrics and status, so that I can monitor system performance and make informed routing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display real-time routing metrics including request volume, response times, and success rates
2. WHEN routing rules are active THEN the system SHALL show which models are being used and their current load distribution
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error rates and types with drill-down capabilities
4. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic routes with visual indicators
5. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide time-series charts for the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days

### Requirement 2: Cost Analytics Interface

**User Story:** As a financial administrator, I want detailed cost analytics for AI model usage, so that I can track spending, optimize costs, and set appropriate budgets.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN cost data is viewed THEN the system SHALL display current spending by model, time period, and cost center
2. WHEN budget limits are set THEN the system SHALL track spending against budgets and show remaining allocations
3. WHEN cost trends are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide forecasting based on historical usage patterns
4. WHEN cost alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL notify administrators when spending thresholds are approached
5. WHEN detailed breakdowns are requested THEN the system SHALL show cost per request, per token, and per user/department

### Requirement 3: Steering Rules Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create and manage steering rules for AI routing, so that I can optimize performance, costs, and quality based on business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating steering rules THEN the system SHALL provide a visual rule builder with conditions and actions
2. WHEN rules are defined THEN the system SHALL support conditions based on request type, user role, cost limits, and performance requirements
3. WHEN rules conflict THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution with priority ordering
4. WHEN rules are activated THEN the system SHALL show real-time impact on routing decisions
5. WHEN rules are tested THEN the system SHALL provide a simulation mode to preview routing changes

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time monitoring of AI routing performance, so that I can quickly identify and respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL display live metrics updating every 5 seconds
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight unusual patterns in routing or performance
3. WHEN system health changes THEN the system SHALL provide status indicators for each AI model and routing component
4. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL display notifications with severity levels and recommended actions
5. WHEN detailed investigation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide drill-down capabilities to individual requests

### Requirement 5: Model Management Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage AI model configurations and availability, so that I can control which models are used and how they're configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing models THEN the system SHALL display all available models with their current status, capabilities, and configuration
2. WHEN configuring models THEN the system SHALL allow setting parameters like timeout, retry logic, and cost limits
3. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show status and allow manual override or failover configuration
4. WHEN new models are added THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration wizard with validation
5. WHEN model performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL show comparative metrics across different models

### Requirement 6: User Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to control access to the RelayCore admin interface, so that only authorized personnel can modify routing configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users access the interface THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the existing JWT system
2. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control with admin, operator, and viewer roles
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require additional confirmation or multi-factor authentication
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all administrative actions with user, timestamp, and change details
5. WHEN session management is required THEN the system SHALL handle session timeouts and secure logout

### Requirement 7: Integration with Shared Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RelayCore admin interface to use the shared foundation components, so that it maintains consistency with other system interfaces and reduces development time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN UI components are needed THEN the system SHALL use StatusIndicator, MetricCard, and SystemBadge from shared components
2. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use the unified API client for type-safe communication
4. WHEN themes are applied THEN the system SHALL use automotive theming consistent with other system interfaces
5. WHEN responsive design is needed THEN the system SHALL use shared utility functions and responsive patterns

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the admin interface to perform well even with large amounts of data, so that I can effectively manage high-volume AI routing scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN large datasets are displayed THEN the system SHALL use virtualization and pagination to maintain performance
2. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL use efficient WebSocket connections without overwhelming the browser
3. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering for smooth interactions even with thousands of data points
4. WHEN data is filtered THEN the system SHALL provide responsive search and filtering without blocking the UI
5. WHEN the interface scales THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-2-second response times for all user interactions

## Success Metrics

- **User Interface Completeness**: All 5 major interface sections fully functional
- **Real-Time Performance**: <2 second response time for all dashboard updates
- **Data Accuracy**: 100% accuracy in cost calculations and routing metrics
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation with <3 clicks to reach any function
- **Integration Quality**: 100% usage of shared foundation components where applicable

## Technical Constraints

- **Shared Foundation Dependency**: Must use completed shared components and design tokens
- **Authentication Integration**: Must integrate with existing JWT authentication system
- **API Compatibility**: Must work with existing RelayCore backend APIs
- **Browser Support**: Must support modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **Performance Requirements**: Must handle 1000+ concurrent routing decisions without UI lag

## Dependencies

- **Shared Foundation**: ✅ Completed (StatusIndicator, MetricCard, SystemBadge, design tokens)
- **Authentication System**: ✅ Available (JWT-based auth system)
- **RelayCore Backend**: Must provide necessary APIs for admin functions
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Required for real-time monitoring capabilities
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Should be completed before or during this implementation

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Availability**: Verify all required RelayCore APIs exist before starting UI development
- **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic data volumes early in development
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from system administrators during development
- **Incremental Delivery**: Implement dashboard sections incrementally for early validation
- **Fallback Options**: Provide graceful degradation when real-time features are unavailable
