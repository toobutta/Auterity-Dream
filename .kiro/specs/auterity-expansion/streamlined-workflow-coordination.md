## 📊 Real-Time Coordination Dashboard

### **Shared Status Tracking System**

#### Task Status Matrix
```markdown
| Stream | Current Task | Status | Blockers | ETA | Quality Gate |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|-----|--------------|
| Amazon Q | Test Infrastructure Repair | 🔄 Active | Module resolution | 2 days | Testing enabled |

```

#### Automated Conflict Detection
```typescript
interface ConflictDetection {
  apiContractChanges: boolean;
  databaseSchemaConflicts: boolean;
  componentInterfaceChanges: boolean;
  integrationPointModifications: boolean;
}

// Automated alerts when conflicts detected
const detectConflicts = (streamA: TaskStatus, streamB: TaskStatus) => {
  if (streamA.apiChanges && streamB.dependsOnAPI) {
    alert("API contract conflict detected - coordination required");
  }
};
```

### **Real-Time Communication Channels**

#### Primary Channel: Direct Tool Messaging
```markdown
**Implementation:** Shared markdown files for real-time updates
**Location:** .kiro/coordination/real-time-status.md
**Update Frequency:** Every 30 minutes during active development
**Format:** Structured status updates with timestamps
```

## ⚡ Workflow Optimization Patterns

### **1. API Contract-First Development**

#### Contract Definition Phase
```yaml
# API Contract Example
WorkflowExecutionAPI:
  endpoints:
    - POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute
    - GET /api/workflows/{id}/status
    - WebSocket /ws/workflows/{id}/logs
  
  types:
    WorkflowExecution:
      id: string
      status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed'
      logs: LogEntry[]
      
  validation:
    - Request/response schema validation
    - Type safety enforcement
    - Error handling patterns
```

#### Parallel Implementation
```markdown
**Amazon Q:** Implement backend API endpoints against contract
**Cursor:** Develop frontend components with contract-based types
**Integration:** Automated contract validation and testing
```

### **2. Component-Driven UI Development**

#### Independent Component Development
```markdown
**Strategy:** Storybook-driven component development
**Benefits:** 
- Independent UI development without backend
- Visual regression testing
- Component reusability validation
- Design system compliance

**Implementation:**
- Each component developed in isolation
- Mock data for all component states
- Automated visual testing
- Integration through composition
```

### **3. Event-Driven Integration**

#### Asynchronous Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Event-driven integration
interface SystemEvent {
  type: 'workflow.executed' | 'user.authenticated' | 'model.updated';
  payload: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  source: 'autmatrix' | 'neuroweaver' | 'relaycore';
}

// Loose coupling through events
const handleWorkflowEvent = (event: SystemEvent) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'workflow.executed':
      updateDashboard(event.payload);
      break;
  }
};
```

2. Direct tool-to-tool resolution attempt (30 minutes)
3. Kiro coordination if unresolved
4. Human intervention for critical issues
```
