# TypeScript Compliance Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for achieving complete TypeScript compliance in the AutoMatrix frontend codebase. The current system has 108 TypeScript linting errors that are blocking clean development and preventing proper type safety enforcement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Type Safety Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript code to use proper type definitions instead of `any` types, so that I can catch type-related errors at compile time and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the linting process runs THEN the system SHALL show 0 TypeScript errors
2. WHEN any type is encountered THEN the system SHALL replace it with proper TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN code is compiled THEN the system SHALL enforce strict type checking without bypassing
4. IF a type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL use union types or generic constraints instead of `any`

### Requirement 2: React Hook Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React hooks to have proper dependency arrays, so that components re-render correctly and avoid memory leaks or stale closures.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN useEffect hooks are defined THEN the system SHALL include all dependencies in the dependency array
2. WHEN dependencies change frequently THEN the system SHALL use useCallback or useMemo appropriately
3. WHEN exhaustive-deps warnings occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them without disabling the rule
4. IF a dependency is intentionally omitted THEN the system SHALL include a comment explaining why

### Requirement 3: Code Cleanliness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables and imports to be removed, so that the codebase remains clean and bundle size is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN imports are declared THEN the system SHALL only include imports that are actually used
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN the system SHALL only include variables that are referenced
3. WHEN function parameters are defined THEN unused parameters SHALL be prefixed with underscore or removed
4. WHEN React components are imported THEN the system SHALL verify they are actually rendered

### Requirement 4: JSX Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JSX to use proper HTML entity escaping, so that the code follows React best practices and avoids potential rendering issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN quotes are used in JSX THEN the system SHALL use `&quot;` instead of raw quotes
2. WHEN apostrophes are used in JSX THEN the system SHALL use `&apos;` instead of raw apostrophes
3. WHEN special characters are used THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTML entities
4. WHEN JSX content contains user data THEN the system SHALL ensure proper escaping

### Requirement 5: Component Interface Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components to have properly typed props interfaces, so that component usage is type-safe and self-documenting.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN components are defined THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript interfaces for all props
2. WHEN props are optional THEN the system SHALL mark them as optional in the interface
3. WHEN props have default values THEN the system SHALL reflect this in the type definition
4. WHEN components use children THEN the system SHALL properly type the children prop

### Requirement 6: API Integration Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API calls to have proper request and response types, so that data flow is type-safe and API contracts are enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL define interfaces for request payloads
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL define interfaces for response data
3. WHEN error responses occur THEN the system SHALL have typed error interfaces
4. WHEN API data is transformed THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety throughout

### Requirement 7: Test Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to use proper TypeScript types, so that tests are reliable and catch type-related issues in the code being tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN mock data is created THEN the system SHALL use proper interfaces matching real data
2. WHEN test assertions are made THEN the system SHALL use typed expectations
3. WHEN test utilities are used THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN component testing occurs THEN the system SHALL use typed render functions and queries

### Requirement 8: Build Process Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to enforce TypeScript compliance, so that type errors are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL fail if TypeScript errors exist
2. WHEN linting occurs THEN the system SHALL enforce all TypeScript rules without exceptions
3. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript checking as a required step
4. WHEN development server starts THEN the system SHALL show TypeScript errors in real-time

## Success Metrics

- **Linting Errors**: Reduce from 108 to 0 (100% reduction)
- **Type Coverage**: Achieve 95%+ type coverage across all frontend files
- **Build Performance**: Maintain or improve current build times
- **Developer Experience**: Provide better IntelliSense and error detection
- **Code Quality**: Improve maintainability and reduce runtime type errors

## Technical Constraints

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality must be preserved
- **Performance**: No performance regressions in runtime or build time
- **Testing**: All existing tests must continue to pass
- **Bundle Size**: No significant increase in production bundle size
- **Development Workflow**: Changes should improve, not hinder, development experience

## Dependencies

- **Security Fixes**: ✅ Completed (Amazon Q resolved all security vulnerabilities)
- **Backend Quality**: ✅ Completed (Backend linting violations resolved)
- **Shared Foundation**: ✅ Completed (Shared components and API client ready)
- **Build System**: Must remain functional throughout the process
- **Test Infrastructure**: Should be compatible with type improvements

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental Implementation**: Fix files one at a time to minimize risk
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full test suite after each major change
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain git history for easy rollback if issues arise
- **Peer Review**: Have changes reviewed before merging
- **Staging Validation**: Test changes in staging environment before production
