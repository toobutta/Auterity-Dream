## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Critical Priority Queue (Must Execute Today)

1. **CLINE-TASK-SECURITY** ðŸ”´ - Fix 7 security vulnerabilities immediately
2. **CLINE-TASK-BACKEND** ðŸ”´ - Resolve 500+ backend linting violations
3. **CLINE-TASK-TESTS** ðŸŸ¡ - Fix 35 failed tests and memory issues
4. **CLINE-TASK-BUNDLE** ðŸŸ¡ - Optimize 1.5MB bundle to <1MB

### Sequential Execution Strategy

Tasks must be completed in exact order due to dependencies:

```
Security Fixes â†’ Backend Quality â†’ Test Infrastructure â†’ Bundle Optimization
```

### Quality Gates Established

Each task must pass validation before proceeding to next task:

- Security: `npm audit` returns 0 vulnerabilities
- Backend: `flake8 .` returns 0 violations
- Tests: 95%+ success rate achieved
- Bundle: <1MB total size achieved
