# Delegation Decision Log

## [2025-01-31 Current] Tool Reallocation Update
- **Decision**: TOOL REASSIGNMENT
- **Change**: Cline tasks delegated to Cursor IDE
- **Reasoning**: User preference for Cursor IDE over Cline for frontend development
- **Impact**: All frontend TypeScript and WebSocket tasks now pending Amazon Q completion
- **New Workflow**: Amazon Q (security/backend) → Cursor (frontend) → Expansion features

# Previous Delegation Decisions

## [2025-01-31 15:45] Task: Pre-Development Monitoring Integration Analysis
- **Decision**: DELEGATED
- **Tool Assigned**: CLINE
- **Reasoning**: Task involves standard component development, API integration analysis, and template creation - all core Cline capabilities
- **Violation**: None
- **Corrective Action**: N/A

**Task Context:**
- User requested #cline pre-planning development work
- Recent Prometheus configuration update indicates monitoring integration priority
- Task involves analyzing existing monitoring implementations across three systems
- Requires creating development templates and integration planning
- No security, debugging, or architecture decisions involved

**Delegation Justification:**
- Standard component development: ✅ (Dashboard components, metrics displays)
- API integration analysis: ✅ (Cross-system metrics APIs)
- Template creation: ✅ (React components, FastAPI services)
- Code analysis: ✅ (Existing monitoring implementations)
- Documentation: ✅ (Implementation guides and roadmaps)

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete analysis of existing monitoring across AutoMatrix, RelayCore, NeuroWeaver
- Development templates for unified monitoring dashboard
- API standardization plan for cross-system metrics
- Implementation roadmap with clear milestones
- All deliverables follow existing project conventions

## Delegation Success Metrics
- **Delegation Rate**: 100% of eligible tasks properly delegated
- **Violation Count**: 0 violations this session
- **Tool Efficiency**: Cline assigned appropriate development analysis task
- **Quality Impact**: Pre-development analysis will improve implementation quality
