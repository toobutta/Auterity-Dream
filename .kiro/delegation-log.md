# Delegation Decision Log

## [2025-01-08 15:45] Task: Pre-Development Preparation for Three-System Integration
- **Decision**: DELEGATED
- **Tool Assigned**: CLINE
- **Reasoning**: Task involves standard component development, API integration analysis, and template creation - all core Cline competencies. No security, debugging, or architecture decisions required.
- **Violation**: None
- **Corrective Action**: N/A

**Task Details:**
- Pre-development analysis of existing codebase patterns
- Component template creation based on existing AutoMatrix patterns
- API integration template development
- Configuration template setup
- Development roadmap creation

**Delegation Success Metrics:**
- **Delegation Rate**: 100% - Properly delegated eligible task
- **Violation Count**: 0 violations
- **Tool Efficiency**: Cline assigned appropriate development preparation task
- **Quality Impact**: Expected high quality due to proper tool assignment

**Next Steps:**
- Cline to begin immediate analysis of existing code patterns
- Focus on leveraging extensive existing AutoMatrix codebase
- Create reusable templates for rapid three-system integration
- Prepare comprehensive development roadmap

## Delegation Quality Gates Status
- ✅ **Zero Tolerance**: No security tasks assigned to non-Amazon Q tools
- ✅ **High Priority**: No debugging tasks assigned to non-Amazon Q tools  
- ✅ **Standard Practice**: Component development properly assigned to Cline
- ✅ **Architecture Only**: Kiro handling only delegation and oversight tasks
