# Quick Start: Kiro + Copilot Integration Workflow
## Get Started in 10 Minutes

### Step 1: VS Code Workspace Setup (3 minutes)

#### Create Multi-Project Workspace
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **File → Add Folder to Workspace**
   - Add your current AutoMatrix project root
   - Add `PRD/RelayCore` folder  
   - Add `PRD/TuneDev` folder
3. **File → Save Workspace As** → `auterity-integration.code-workspace`

#### Verify GitHub Copilot
1. **Check Status**: Look for Copilot icon in status bar
2. **Test Chat**: Open Copilot Chat panel (Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. **Test Command**: Type `@workspace What is this project about?`

### Step 2: Kiro Integration Test (2 minutes)

#### Test Kiro Analysis
Run this command in Kiro:
```
"Analyze the integration requirements between AutoMatrix, RelayCore, and TuneDev based on the PRD files"
```

Expected output: Kiro should identify key integration points and challenges.

### Step 3: First Integration Task (5 minutes)

#### Immediate Priority: Security Vulnerabilities
**Kiro Command:**
```
"Identify the 7 security vulnerabilities in the project and prioritize them for fixing"
```

**VS Code + Copilot Task:**
1. Open `package.json` and `requirements.txt`
2. **Copilot Chat**: `@workspace What security vulnerabilities exist in our dependencies?`
3. **Copilot Chat**: `Help me create a plan to fix these security issues`

### Step 4: Validate Workflow (1 minute)

#### Test the Integration
1. **Kiro**: Should provide strategic analysis and planning
2. **Copilot**: Should provide specific code suggestions and fixes
3. **Both**: Should work on the same files and understand the project context

## Your First Day Action Plan

### Morning (30 minutes)
1. **Kiro Analysis** (15 minutes):
   ```
   "Create a comprehensive analysis of the current AutoMatrix codebase quality issues and their impact on RelayCore and TuneDev integration"
   ```

2. **VS Code Setup** (15 minutes):
   - Open the workspace
   - Run `npm audit` and `pip check` to see current issues
   - Use Copilot Chat to understand the codebase structure

### First Work Session (2 hours)
1. **Planning (Kiro - 15 minutes)**:
   ```
   "Plan the first integration milestone: connecting AutoMatrix workflow engine with RelayCore HTTP proxy"
   ```

2. **Implementation (VS Code + Copilot - 90 minutes)**:
   - Create a new file: `backend/app/services/relaycore_client.py`
   - **Copilot**: `Generate a FastAPI client for RelayCore HTTP proxy integration`
   - Implement basic connection and error handling

3. **Review (Kiro - 15 minutes)**:
   ```
   "Review the RelayCore client implementation and assess integration readiness"
   ```

### Afternoon (2 hours)
1. **Security Focus (Kiro + Copilot)**:
   - **Kiro**: Prioritize the 7 security vulnerabilities
   - **Copilot**: Generate fixes for dependency vulnerabilities
   - Test fixes and validate they don't break existing functionality

### End of Day (15 minutes)
1. **Progress Review (Kiro)**:
   ```
   "Generate a progress report for day 1 of the integration project"
   ```

2. **Tomorrow Planning**:
   - Define 3 specific tasks for tomorrow
   - Identify any blockers or dependencies
   - Update project documentation

## Troubleshooting

### If Kiro Seems Confused
- Provide more specific context: `"Based on the files in PRD/RelayCore/, analyze..."`
- Reference specific files: `"Looking at backend/app/models/workflow.py, how should..."`
- Break down complex requests into smaller parts

### If Copilot Isn't Helpful
- Use more specific prompts: `"Generate a FastAPI endpoint that accepts RelayCore steering rules"`
- Provide context: `@workspace Based on our existing FastAPI patterns, create...`
- Reference existing code: `"Similar to the existing auth endpoints, create..."`

### If Integration Seems Overwhelming
- Focus on one system at a time (start with RelayCore)
- Use Kiro for breaking down complex tasks
- Implement small, testable increments
- Regular quality checks prevent technical debt accumulation
