## Title: Auto-RLAIF Feedback Engine and Smart Dataset Optimizer

### Objective
Develop a feedback-driven fine-tuning system using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), paired with an automated data refinement engine to reduce human labor and boost fine-tuning efficiency.

### Features
- RLAIF Engine with pluggable prompt generators (summarization, QA, classification)
- Smart Dataset Optimizer to identify imbalance, noise, and redundancy
- Integration with Hugging Face PEFT (QLoRA)
- Configurable YAML launch templates

### Milestones
1. RLAIF module architecture (Week 1-2)
2. Feedback generator agents (Week 2-4)
3. Dataset anomaly detection (Week 3-5)
4. System integration + testbed (Week 5-6)

### Success Metrics
- >75% reduction in manual annotation cost
- 30% improved accuracy in downstream tasks
- <10% performance delta vs. human-annotated models
