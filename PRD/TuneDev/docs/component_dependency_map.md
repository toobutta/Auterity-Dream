## Continuous Integration Strategy

To support the parallel development tracks, we recommend the following CI/CD approach:

1. **Component-Level Testing**
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for dependent components
   - Automated test runs on each commit

2. **Track-Level Integration**
   - Daily integration of components within each track
   - Automated integration tests for each track

3. **Cross-Track Integration**
   - Weekly integration across all tracks
   - Full system tests on integrated components

4. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Automated deployment to development environment
   - Staged deployment to testing environment
   - Manual approval for production deployment

## Conclusion

This dependency map provides a clear understanding of the relationships between NeuroWeaver components, enabling optimized workflow planning and efficient resource allocation. By following the recommended development tracks and sequence, the implementation timeline can be reduced from 24 weeks to 18 weeks while maintaining high quality and comprehensive functionality.

The template-first approach, combined with parallel development tracks, ensures that the most valuable components are developed early, providing immediate benefits to Auterity while the full system is being implemented.
