# NeuroWeaver Automotive Templates Usage Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for using the NeuroWeaver Automotive Industry Templates. These templates are designed to accelerate the development and deployment of specialized AI models for automotive applications, including dealership operations, service advising, sales assistance, and parts inventory management.

## Template Overview

The NeuroWeaver Automotive Industry Kit includes the following templates:

1. **Dealership Operations** - For general dealership management and operations
2. **Service Advisor** - For service department and maintenance advising
3. **Sales Assistant** - For sales and customer relationship management
4. **Parts Inventory** - For parts department and inventory management

Each template is designed to address specific use cases within the automotive industry and includes optimized parameters, dataset requirements, and deployment recommendations.

## Template Structure

All templates follow a consistent structure:

```yaml
metadata:
  # Template identification and versioning information
  
template:
  # Core template configuration with variable placeholders
  
example:
  # Complete working example with specific values
  
variables:
  # Detailed variable definitions with types, defaults, and options
  
use_cases:
  # Specific applications and recommended configurations
  
integration_points:
  # Systems and data sources for integration
  
deployment_recommendations:
  # Environment-specific deployment configurations
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the templates, ensure you have:

1. Access to the NeuroWeaver platform
2. Appropriate datasets for your specific use case
3. Understanding of your deployment environment requirements
4. Necessary API access for integrations

### Template Selection

Choose the appropriate template based on your specific needs:

- **Dealership Operations**: For general dealership management, customer service automation, inventory management, and multi-department coordination
- **Service Advisor**: For maintenance procedure assistance, service recommendations, diagnostic assistance, and customer communication about technical issues
- **Sales Assistant**: For customer interactions, vehicle feature explanations, financing options, and competitive comparisons
- **Parts Inventory**: For parts identification, inventory management, compatibility checking, and supplier interactions

### Template Customization

Templates can be customized through the NeuroWeaver platform in three ways:

1. **No-Code Workflow Builder**: Use the visual interface to customize templates without writing code
2. **YAML Editor**: Directly edit the template YAML for advanced customization
3. **API Integration**: Programmatically create and customize templates via the NeuroWeaver API

## Using the No-Code Workflow Builder

The No-Code Workflow Builder provides a visual interface for customizing templates:

1. **Select Template**: Choose from the available automotive templates
2. **Configure Variables**: Set values for required and optional variables
3. **Connect Data Sources**: Link to your datasets and integration points
4. **Set Deployment Options**: Configure deployment settings
5. **Save and Deploy**: Save your configuration and deploy the model

### Example Workflow: Service Advisor Template

1. Select the "Service Advisor" template
2. Configure:
   - Base model: mistral-7b
   - Fine-tuning method: QLoRA
   - Dataset: Your maintenance procedures dataset
   - Parameters: Use recommended values or customize
3. Connect to your Service Management System
4. Set deployment for your environment
5. Deploy the model

## Using the YAML Editor

For advanced customization, you can directly edit the template YAML:

1. Select the template in the NeuroWeaver platform
2. Open the YAML editor
3. Modify the configuration as needed
4. Validate the YAML syntax
5. Save and deploy

### Example: Customizing the Sales Assistant Template

```yaml
template:
  task: "vertical-tune"
  vertical: "automotive"
  specialization: "sales_assistant"
  model: "llama-13b"  # Changed from default
  method: "QLoRA"
  dataset: "./datasets/custom_sales_data.jsonl"  # Custom dataset
  parameters:
    epochs: 5  # Increased from default
    learning_rate: 1e-4  # Modified
    batch_size: 4  # Reduced for larger model
    lora_r: 32  # Increased rank
    lora_alpha: 64  # Adjusted scaling
    lora_dropout: 0.1  # Modified dropout
```

## Dataset Requirements

Each template has specific dataset requirements:

### Dealership Operations
- Customer service conversations
- Inventory management data
- Inter-department communications
- Dealership analytics and reporting

### Service Advisor
- Maintenance procedures and manuals
- Service histories and recommendations
- Diagnostic trouble codes and procedures
- Technical-to-layman explanations

### Sales Assistant
- Sales conversations and customer interactions
- Vehicle specifications and feature descriptions
- Financing and leasing information
- Competitive comparison data

### Parts Inventory
- Parts catalogs and specifications
- Inventory data and sales history
- Parts compatibility information
- Supplier communications and ordering procedures

## Integration Points

Templates include integration points with common automotive systems:

- **DMS (Dealership Management System)**
- **CRM Systems**
- **Service Management Systems**
- **Parts Inventory Systems**
- **Finance and Insurance Systems**
- **RelayCore Platform**

### Configuring RelayCore Integration

The RelayCore integration enables seamless data exchange:

1. Obtain RelayCore API credentials
2. Configure the connector in the template
3. Set up data synchronization parameters
4. Test the connection
5. Enable real-time data exchange

## Deployment Options

Templates include deployment recommendations for different environments:

### Development
- Smaller instance types
- Basic quantization
- No auto-scaling

### Testing
- Mid-range instances
- Standard quantization
- Limited scaling

### Production
- Optimized instance types
- Advanced quantization
- Full auto-scaling configuration

## Performance Optimization

To optimize model performance:

1. **Dataset Quality**: Ensure high-quality, diverse, and representative data
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rate, batch size, and epochs based on your dataset
3. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate base model for your use case
4. **Quantization**: Select the right quantization method for your deployment environment
5. **Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling based on expected usage patterns

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track inference latency, throughput, and resource utilization
2. **Quality Evaluation**: Monitor output quality and user feedback
3. **Retraining**: Schedule periodic retraining with new data
4. **Version Management**: Maintain version control for templates and models
5. **Cost Optimization**: Use the CostGuard Dashboard to optimize resource usage

## Best Practices

### Template Selection
- Start with the most specific template for your use case
- Consider combining multiple templates for comprehensive solutions
- Review use case recommendations within each template

### Dataset Preparation
- Include diverse examples covering all expected scenarios
- Balance dataset across different categories
- Include both common and edge cases
- Ensure proper formatting and cleaning

### Fine-tuning
- Start with recommended parameters
- Use smaller epochs for initial testing
- Gradually adjust parameters based on performance
- Save checkpoints during training

### Deployment
- Start with development configuration
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Monitor performance during initial deployment
- Scale resources based on actual usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Poor model performance | Insufficient or low-quality data | Expand and improve training dataset |
| High latency | Insufficient compute resources | Upgrade instance type or optimize quantization |
| Integration failures | API configuration issues | Verify credentials and endpoint configurations |
| Out-of-memory errors | Batch size too large | Reduce batch size or use gradient accumulation |
| Unexpected outputs | Dataset bias or gaps | Review and balance training data |

## Template Versioning

Templates follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible changes requiring significant updates
- **MINOR**: New features in backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

Always check the template version before deployment and review change logs for updates.
