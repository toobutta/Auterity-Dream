# Preparing the Dataset

After selecting the Service Advisor Template, the customer needs to prepare their dataset for model specialization:

1. Navigate to the **Dataset Manager** from the main navigation menu
2. Click the **Upload Dataset** button to begin the process

## Dataset Upload Process

The customer will see a dialog where they can:
1. Provide a name for their dataset (e.g., "Service Records 2025")
2. Add a description (e.g., "Customer service interactions and maintenance records")
3. Upload their data file(s) - the platform accepts various formats including CSV, JSON, JSONL, and Excel
4. Add relevant tags for easier searching later (e.g., "automotive", "service", "maintenance")

## Dataset Refinement

Once uploaded, the customer can refine their dataset to improve quality:

1. In the **Refinement** tab, they click **New Refinement** to start the process
2. They select their uploaded dataset ("Service Records 2025")
3. They choose appropriate refinement operations:
   - **Data Cleaning** to remove duplicates and fix formatting issues
   - **Text Normalization** to standardize text fields
   - **Content Filtering** to remove irrelevant or sensitive information

## Dataset Analysis

After refinement, the customer can analyze their dataset:

1. In the **Analytics** tab, they can view:
   - Distribution of data across different categories
   - Quality metrics for their dataset
   - Potential issues or biases in the data
   - Recommendations for further improvements

The platform automatically validates that the dataset meets the requirements specified in the Service Advisor Template, ensuring it contains the necessary fields and format for successful model specialization.

By using the Dataset Manager's refinement tools, the customer ensures their dataset is high-quality and properly formatted, which is critical for effective model specialization.
