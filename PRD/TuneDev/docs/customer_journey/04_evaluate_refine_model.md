# Evaluating and Refining the Model

Once training is complete, the customer needs to evaluate their specialized Service Advisor model to ensure it meets their requirements:

1. From the Model Gallery, they select their newly trained "DealershipX Service Advisor Model"
2. They navigate to the **Details** view to see comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation page shows:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: 92% (how often the model provides correct responses)
   - **F1 Score**: 0.89 (balance of precision and recall)
   - **Precision**: 0.91 (accuracy of positive predictions)
   - **Recall**: 0.87 (ability to find all relevant instances)

2. **Comparison to Baseline**:
   - Side-by-side comparison with the generic model
   - Improvement percentages for each metric
   - Visual charts showing performance differences

3. **Domain-Specific Metrics**:
   - **Service Knowledge Accuracy**: 94% (accuracy on service procedure questions)
   - **Parts Identification**: 88% (accuracy in identifying correct parts)
   - **Customer Interaction Quality**: 90% (appropriateness of responses to customers)

## Interactive Testing

The customer can interactively test their model:

1. They click on the **Test Model** tab
2. They enter sample queries that service advisors might encounter:
   - "What's the recommended maintenance schedule for a 2024 Highlander Hybrid?"
   - "How long does a brake fluid flush typically take?"
   - "What are the symptoms of a failing water pump?"

3. They review the model's responses for:
   - Accuracy of information
   - Completeness of answers
   - Appropriate tone and language
   - Response time

## Model Refinement

If the customer identifies areas for improvement, they can refine their model:

1. They click **Refine Model** to begin the process
2. They can choose from several refinement options:
   - **Additional Training**: Add more epochs with the same dataset
   - **Dataset Enhancement**: Add more examples for problematic areas
   - **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust specific parameters like learning rate
   - **Prompt Engineering**: Refine system prompts for better responses

3. For this example, the customer chooses to enhance their dataset:
   - They add more examples of complex service procedures
   - They upload additional customer interaction examples
   - The system automatically merges this with their existing dataset

4. They initiate a focused training run that builds on the existing model rather than starting from scratch

This evaluation and refinement process is iterative, allowing the customer to continuously improve their model until it meets their specific requirements. The platform provides guidance at each step, suggesting the most effective refinement strategies based on the evaluation results.
