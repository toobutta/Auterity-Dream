# Customer Journey: Specializing an AI Model with NeuroWeaver

This document outlines the end-to-end process a customer would follow to specialize an AI model for their automotive dealership using the NeuroWeaver platform. The journey demonstrates how the template-first approach simplifies and accelerates the process of creating, training, and deploying specialized AI models.

## Journey Overview

### 1. Select a Template

The customer begins by selecting the **Service Advisor Template** from the **Automotive Dealership Kit** in the Model Gallery. This template is pre-configured with:
- Base model: Mistral-7B
- Fine-tuning method: QLoRA
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score
- Deployment configuration: vLLM with INT8 quantization

**Time saved**: 2-3 weeks of research and configuration

### 2. Prepare Dataset

The customer uploads their service records dataset to the Dataset Manager and uses the built-in refinement tools to:
- Clean and normalize the data
- Filter out irrelevant or sensitive information
- Validate the dataset against template requirements
- Analyze data quality and distribution

**Time saved**: 1-2 weeks of data preparation and engineering

### 3. Configure and Train Model

Using the pre-filled configuration form based on the Service Advisor Template, the customer:
- Provides a name for their specialized model
- Selects their refined dataset
- Reviews and optionally adjusts the pre-optimized training parameters
- Initiates the automated training process

**Time saved**: 3-4 weeks of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and training setup

### 4. Evaluate and Refine Model

After training, the customer:
- Reviews comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Tests the model interactively with real-world queries
- Identifies areas for improvement
- Refines the model through additional training or dataset enhancement

**Time saved**: 1-2 weeks of evaluation framework development and refinement cycles

### 5. Deploy and Integrate Model

Finally, the customer:
- Deploys the model using pre-optimized deployment settings
- Selects from multiple integration options (API, pre-built connectors, no-code)
- Monitors performance and costs through the CostGuard Dashboard
- Manages the model lifecycle through the Management Console

**Time saved**: 2-3 weeks of deployment infrastructure setup and integration development

## Total Impact

By using the NeuroWeaver platform with its template-first approach, the customer has:

- **Reduced time-to-value** from 9-14 weeks to just 2-3 days (95% reduction)
- **Decreased technical complexity** by leveraging pre-built templates and automation
- **Lowered costs** by using optimized training and deployment configurations
- **Improved quality** through industry-specific best practices built into templates

## Real-World Application

In a dealership environment, this specialized Service Advisor model can:

1. **Enhance service advisor capabilities**:
   - Provide accurate maintenance recommendations
   - Answer technical questions about vehicle systems
   - Suggest appropriate service procedures based on symptoms

2. **Improve customer experience**:
   - Ensure consistent and accurate information across all advisors
   - Reduce wait times for information lookup
   - Provide detailed explanations of service recommendations

3. **Increase operational efficiency**:
   - Reduce time spent researching technical information
   - Decrease training time for new service advisors
   - Improve accuracy of service estimates and recommendations

## Conclusion

The NeuroWeaver platform's template-first approach transforms the complex, time-consuming process of AI model specialization into a streamlined, accessible workflow that can be completed in days rather than months. This enables automotive dealerships to quickly deploy specialized AI models that address their specific needs without requiring extensive AI expertise or resources.

By following this journey, customers can create specialized AI models that deliver immediate business value while maintaining high quality and performance standards.
