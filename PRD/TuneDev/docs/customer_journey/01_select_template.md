# Selecting a Template

When a customer first logs into the NeuroWeaver platform, they'll see the dashboard with an overview of their models, datasets, and system metrics. To begin specializing a model, they would:

1. Navigate to the **Model Gallery** from the main navigation menu
2. Browse the available templates in the **Vertical Kits** tab
3. Select the **Automotive Dealership Kit** which contains pre-configured templates for automotive use cases

The customer can see details about each template including:
- Description and purpose
- Included models and datasets
- Performance metrics from previous implementations
- User ratings and reviews

For our example, the customer selects the **Service Advisor Template** which is designed specifically for automotive service departments. This template is pre-configured with:
- Base model: Mistral-7B
- Fine-tuning method: QLoRA
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score
- Deployment configuration: vLLM with INT8 quantization

By selecting a template rather than starting from scratch, the customer saves significant time and benefits from industry best practices built into the template.
