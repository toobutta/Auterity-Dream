## Vertical Industry Kits

NeuroWeaver includes specialized kits for various industries:

### Automotive Industry Kit

The Automotive Industry Kit provides specialized components for fine-tuning and deploying AI models for automotive industry applications, including dealerships, OEMs, and automotive groups.

#### Features:

- Pre-built datasets for dealership operations, vehicle specifications, maintenance procedures, and sales conversations
- Specialized templates for dealership operations, service advising, sales assistance, and parts inventory
- Integration with RelayCore platform for seamless data exchange
- Optimized models for automotive industry use cases

To use the Automotive Industry Kit:

```bash
# Create example datasets
python -m vertical_kits.automotive.automotive_kit create_datasets

# Create example templates
python -m vertical_kits.automotive.automotive_kit create_templates

# Set up RelayCore integration
python -m vertical_kits.automotive.automotive_kit setup_relaycore
```

### Other Industry Kits

- **LegalTech Kit**: Specialized for legal document analysis, contract review, and legal research
- **Healthcare AI Kit**: Focused on medical documentation, clinical decision support, and patient engagement
- **FinTech Kit**: Optimized for financial analysis, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance
- **GovTech Kit**: Designed for public service automation, citizen engagement, and policy analysis

## Architecture

NeuroWeaver follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based UI with Material-UI components
- **Backend API**: FastAPI-based REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data
