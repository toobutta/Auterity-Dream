# PRD: Dynamic Inference Agent (DIA)

## Objective
Develop a real-time inference optimizer that routes AI requests to optimal models and runtimes (Triton, vLLM, on-device) based on latency, cost, and accuracy feedback.

## Key Features
- Runtime analysis module
- Dynamic routing rules (quantization, distillation, etc.)
- Usage pattern adaptation
- Integration with CostGuard dashboard
- Override configuration support

## Success Metrics
- 40% cost savings vs static routing
- Sub-100ms latency across 80% of routes
