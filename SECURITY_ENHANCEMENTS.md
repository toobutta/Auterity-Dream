# Security Enhancements Overview

## Changes Implemented

1. **Fail Workflow on Critical Vulnerabilities**:
   - Updated the `security-scan` job to fail the workflow if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     - name: Run frontend security audit
       run: |
         cd frontend
         npm audit --audit-level critical || exit 1
     ```

2. **Pin Action Versions**:
   - Ensured consistent behavior by pinning action versions.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.0
     uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.6.0
     ```

3. **Restrict Workflow Triggers**:
   - Limited workflow triggers to the `main` branch to enhance security.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
         paths-ignore:
           - '**/*.md'
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main
         paths-ignore:
           - '**/*.md'
     ```

4. **Enhanced Security Reports**:
   - Improved visibility by ensuring security reports are uploaded and reviewed.

5. **General Improvements**:
   - Added caching for security tools to improve performance.
   - Ensured compliance with OWASP and NIST standards.

## Summary
These changes enhance the security posture of the CI/CD pipeline by addressing critical vulnerabilities, ensuring consistent behavior, and restricting unauthorized access. Regular reviews and updates are recommended to maintain compliance and security.
